MILITARY / GOVERNMENT CONNECTIONS TO MASS-KILLINGS ORCHESTRATED BY ORGANIZATIONS

[State-sponsored terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-sponsored_terrorism)
>State-sponsored terrorism is terrorist violence carried out with the active support of national governments provided to violent non-state actors. States can sponsor terrorist groups in several ways, including but not limited to funding terrorist organizations, providing training, supplying weapons, providing other logistical and intelligence assistance, and hosting groups within their borders. Because of the pejorative nature of the word, the identification of particular examples are often subject to political dispute and different definitions of terrorism.

[Operation Gladio - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio)
>Operation Gladio is the codename for clandestine "stay-behind" operations of armed resistance that were organized by the Western Union (WU), and subsequently by NATO and the CIA,[1][2] in collaboration with several European intelligence agencies.[3] The operation was designed for a potential Warsaw Pact invasion and conquest of Europe. Although Gladio specifically refers to the Italian branch of the NATO stay-behind organizations, "Operation Gladio" is used as an informal name for all of them. Stay-behind operations were prepared in many NATO member countries, and some neutral countries.[4]
>
>During the Cold War, some anti-communist armed groups engaged in the harassment of left-wing parties, torture, terrorist attacks, and massacres in countries such as Italy.[5][6][7][8] The role of the CIA and other intelligence organisations in Gladio—the extent of its activities during the Cold War era and any responsibility for terrorist attacks perpetrated in Italy during the "Years of Lead" (late 1960s–early 1980s)—is the subject of debate.
>
>In 1990, the European Parliament adopted a resolution alleging that military secret services in certain member states were involved in serious terrorism and crime, whether or not their superiors were aware.[9] The resolution also urged investigations by the judiciaries of the countries in which those armies operated, so that their modus operandi and actual extension would be revealed.[10] To date, only Italy, Switzerland and Belgium have had parliamentary inquiries into the matter.[11][12]
>
>The three inquiries reached differing conclusions as regarded different countries. Guido Salvini, a judge who worked in the Italian Massacres Commission, concluded that some right-wing terrorist organizations of the Years of Lead (La Fenice, National Vanguard and Ordine Nuovo) were the trench troops of a secret army, remotely controlled by exponents of the Italian state apparatus and linked to the CIA.[13] Salvini said that the CIA encouraged them to commit atrocities.[14] The Swiss inquiry found that British intelligence secretly cooperated with their army in an operation named P-26 and provided training in combat, communications, and sabotage.[15] It also discovered that P-26 not only would organize resistance in case of a Soviet invasion, but would also become active should the left succeed in achieving a parliamentary majority.[16] The Belgian inquiry could find no conclusive information on their army. No links between them and terrorist attacks were found, and the inquiry noted that the Belgian secret services refused to provide the identity of agents, which could have eliminated all doubts.[17] A 2000 Italian parliamentary report from the left wing coalition Gruppo Democratici di Sinistra l'Ulivo reported that terrorist massacres and bombings had been organised or promoted or supported by men inside Italian state institutions who were linked to American intelligence. The report also said the United States was guilty of promoting the strategy of tension.[18] Operation Gladio is also suspected to have been activated to counter existing left-wing parliamentary majorities in Europe.[19]
>
>The US State Department published a communiqué in January 2006 that stated claims the United States ordered, supported, or authorized terrorism by stay-behind units, and US-sponsored "false flag" operations are rehashed former Soviet disinformation based on documents that the Soviets forged.[20]
>
>The word gladio is the Italian form of gladius, a type of Roman shortsword.

[Operation Gladio - Wikispooks](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Operation_Gladio)
>Operation Gladio is a NATO-backed paramilitary network established after WW2, reportedly inspired by fear of the USSR. It was also called the "Stay behind network", since if the Red Army invaded Europe, its members would "stay behind" enemy lines to disrupt Soviet control. Officially non-existent, secrecy was so extreme that these networks were hard for NATO/MI6/Deep state officials to control. Gladio was responsible for bombings, kidnappings and assassinations to such an extent that the network was publicly exposed in Italy in the 1980s and was the subject of a BBC documentary by Alan Francovich some years later.[1] The project was adapted in the mid 1990s as "Gladio B", using "Moslem terrorists" as a substitute enemy image for communists.  

[Operation Gladio - Full 1992 documentary BBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGHXjO8wHsA)
>Originally aired on BBC2 in 1992, 'Operation Gladio' reveals 'Gladio', the secret state-sponsored terror network operating in Europe. This BBC series is about a far-right secret army, operated by the CIA and MI6 through NATO, which killed hundreds of innocent Europeans and attempted to blame the deaths on Baader Meinhof, Red Brigades and other left wing groups. Known as 'stay-behinds' these armies were given access to military equipment which was supposed to be used for sabotage after a Soviet invasion. Instead it was used in massacres across mainland Europe as part of a CIA Strategy of Tension. Gladio killing sprees in Belgium and Italy were carried out for the purpose of frightening the national political classes into adopting U.S. policies.

[Operation Gladio: The CIA's Secret Army In Europe](https://www.grunge.com/717106/operation-gladio-the-cias-secret-army-in-europe/)
>During the Cold War, the self-determination of countless countries was greatly influenced by the meddling of the CIA, NATO, and MI6. Fearful of any hint of communism in any country, a network of secret guerrilla armies were scattered across Europe with the goal of suppressing communism. In many cases, violence was also committed by far-right extremists in order to target communists.
>
>This network of stay-behind armies became known as Operation Gladio. And because only a handful of countries have revealed information to the public about the stay-behind networks, there's only a few incidents in which the affiliation of Operation Gladio is confirmed and known for certain. Other incidents, like the Brabant Massacres in Belgium, the Montejurra massacre in Spain, and the assassinations of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, are also alleged to have been associated with Operation Gladio, but there's less evidence with which to say for sure. Their activities also weren't limited to Europe. There are even said to be ties between Operation Gladio and the assassination of Patrice Lumumba.
>
>As time goes on, more and more information will likely come out about the activities of Operation Gladio. But as of 2021, many of its secrets are still being held close. And this piece barely scratches the surface of everything Operation Gladio has been accused of associating with. This is Operation Gladio: The CIA's secret army in Europe.

[NATO's Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe](https://www.amazon.com/NATOs-Secret-Armies-Operation-Contemporary/dp/0714685003)
>This fascinating new study shows how the CIA and the British secret service, in collaboration with the military alliance NATO and European military secret services, set up a network of clandestine anti-communist armies in Western Europe after World War II.
>
>These secret soldiers were trained on remote islands in the Mediterranean and in unorthodox warfare centres in England and in the United States by the Green Berets and SAS Special Forces. The network was armed with explosives, machine guns and high-tech communication equipment hidden in underground bunkers and secret arms caches in forests and mountain meadows. In some countries the secret army linked up with right-wing terrorist who in a secret war engaged in political manipulation, harrassement of left wing parties, massacres, coup d'états and torture.
>
>Codenamed 'Gladio' ('the sword'), the Italian secret army was exposed in 1990 by Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti to the Italian Senate, whereupon the press spoke of "The best kept, and most damaging, political-military secret since World War II" (Observer, 18. November 1990) and observed that "The story seems straight from the pages of a political thriller." (The Times, November 19, 1990). Ever since, so-called 'stay-behind' armies of NATO have also been discovered in France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Greece and Turkey. They were internationally coordinated by the Pentagon and NATO and had their last known meeting in the NATO-linked Allied Clandestine Committee (ACC) in Brussels in October 1990.

[Terrorism in Western Europe: An Approach to NATO’s Secret Stay-Behind Armies](http://physics911.net/pdf/DanieleGanser_Terrorism_in_Western_Europe-1.pdf)
>Recent research has revealed secret armies have existed across Western Europe during the Cold War.1 Coordinated by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), they were run by the European military secret services in close cooperation with the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the British foreign secret service Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, also MI6). Trained together with US Green Berets and British Special Air Service (SAS), these clandestine NATO soldiers, armed with underground arms-caches, prepared against a potential Soviet invasion and occupation of Western Europe, as well as the coming to power of communist parties. The clandestine international network covered the European NATO membership, including Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Turkey, as well as the neutral European countries of Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland.2

>Philip Agee was a CIA officer in Latin American during the 1950s and '60s. Here he discusses how the CIA organized a series of bombings of churches (using far-right provacatuers) in an effort to put pressure on Ecuador's President and to change Ecuador's policy towards communist Cuba. The president would eventually be deposed - the second president deposed in Ecuador by the CIA in less than two years.

[Operation Northwoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods)
>Operation Northwoods was a proposed false flag operation against American citizens that originated within the US Department of Defense of the United States government in 1962. The proposals called for the CIA operatives to both stage and actually commit acts of terrorism against American military and civilian targets, blaming them on the Cuban government, and using it to justify a war against Cuba. The possibilities detailed in the document included the possible assassination of Cuban immigrants, sinking boats of Cuban refugees on the high seas,[2] hijacking planes to be shot down or given the appearance of being shot down,[2] blowing up a U.S. ship, and orchestrating violent terrorism in U.S. cities.[3] The proposals were rejected by President John F. Kennedy.[4][5][6]

[MKUltra - WIkipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKUltra)
>Project MKUltra (or MK-Ultra)[a] was the code name of an illegal human experimentation program designed and undertaken by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).[1][2][3] The experiments were intended to develop procedures and identify drugs such as LSD that could be used in interrogations to weaken individuals and force confessions through brainwashing and psychological torture. MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate its subjects' mental states and brain functions, such as the covert administration of high doses of psychoactive drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, electroshocks,[4] hypnosis,[5][6] sensory deprivation, isolation, and verbal and sexual abuse, in addition to other forms of torture.[7][8]
>
>MKUltra was preceded by two drug-related experiments, Project Bluebird and Project Artichoke.[9][10] It began in 1953, was reduced in scope in 1964 and 1967, and was halted in 1973. It was organized through the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence and coordinated with the United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories.[11] The program engaged in illegal activities,[12][13][14] including the use of U.S. and Canadian citizens as unwitting test subjects.[12]: 74 [15][16][17] MKUltra's scope was broad, with activities carried out under the guise of research at more than 80 institutions, including colleges and universities, hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies.[18] The CIA operated using front organizations, although some top officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA's involvement.[19]
>
>MKUltra was first brought to public attention in 1975 by the Church Committee of the United States Congress and Gerald Ford's United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States (also known as the Rockefeller Commission). Investigative efforts were hampered by CIA Director Richard Helms's order that all MKUltra files be destroyed in 1973; the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the small number of documents that survived Helms's order.[20] In 1977, a Freedom of Information Act request uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents relating to MKUltra, which led to Senate hearings.[12][21] Some surviving information about MKUltra was declassified in July 2001.

[Project ARTICHOKE - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_ARTICHOKE)
>Project ARTICHOKE (also referred to as Operation ARTICHOKE) was a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) project that researched interrogation methods.
>
>Preceded by Project BLUEBIRD, ARTICHOKE officially arose on August 20, 1951 and was operated by the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence.[1] The primary goal of Project ARTICHOKE was to determine whether a person could be involuntarily made to perform an act of attempted assassination.[2] The project also studied hypnosis, forced morphine addiction (and subsequent forced withdrawal) and the use of other chemicals including LSD, to produce amnesia and other vulnerable states in subjects.
>
>Project ARTICHOKE led to Project MKUltra, which began in 1953.[3]

[1949 — CIA’s Research in Covert Mind-Control Techniques i.e., Psychological Torture](https://ahrp.org/1949-cias-research-in-covert-mind-control-techniques-i-e-psychological-torture/)
>In 1949, the Rand Corporation issued a report, “Are Communist Countries Using Hypnosis Techniques to Elicit Confession in Public Trials?” The report relied on old Soviet hypnosis experiments conducted in 1923 (which were translated into English in 1932). The Soviets had reported success in implanting memories of crimes hypnotically. The Rand report helped set the stage for the U.S. government intelligence agencies to invoke national security as the rationale for the use of nefarious destructive mind control methods, such as hypnosis, to manipulate individuals into committing criminal acts on command. (Bowart. Operation Mind Control, 1978; Researcher’s edition, 1994)
>
>Beginning in 1949, the CIA initiated a series of Top Secret mind control projects; their names changed as some morphed one into the other. These dubious, often fiendish experiments in “psychological warfare” techniques spanned more than 25 years. Among these: BLUEBIRD, ARTICHOKE, MK-NAOMI, MK-SEARCH, PANDORA, MIDNIGHT CLIMAX, and MK-ULTRA, the best known of CIA’s mind control projects. The unconscionable experiments tested the malleability of human consciousness; they were designed to erase memory and cause total amnesia using electroshock. The experiments sought to discover effective methods for manipulating human will and to probe the limits of human a being’s capacity to withstand extreme stress. They were essentially experimental explorations in mental torture.
>
>These were brain damaging experiments; they were conducted on thousands of (mostly) involuntary soldiers, mental patients, prisoners and civilians, including young children who were treated as expendable means to CIA’s dubious ends. The victims of CIA’s diabolical experiments were subjected to a witches’ brew of powerful psychoactive and hallucinatory drugs (e.g., mescaline, sodium pentothal, LSD, ketamine and psilocybin) in the hunt for a “truth serum” (“ego-depressant” drugs). Other techniques used in these grotesque experiments included, rapid induction of hypnosis, multiple high voltage electroshock, electronic brain stimulation (ESB), psychosurgical implanted electrodes in the brain, often combined with psychoactive drugs. The third line of CIA’s experimentation involved extremely stressful psychological “brainwashing” employing sleep deprivation and sensory deprivation in extended isolated confinement, coupled with sensory overstimulation, which induced psychotic hallucinations and mental breakdown. The purpose of these monstrous exercises in torture was to incapacitate human free will and break the human spirit by disorienting, inducing “learned helplessness” and dependency, to enable an interrogator to assume control and take command of a subject’s mind.
>
>“Many Americans have heard about the most outlandish and least successful aspect of this research — the testing of LSD on unsuspecting subjects. While these CIA drug experiments led nowhere and the testing of electric shock as a technique led only to lawsuits, research into sensory deprivation proved fruitful indeed. In fact, this research produced a new psychological rather than physical method of torture, perhaps best described as “no-touch” torture.” (McCoy)
>
>For decades the nature of these experiments involving CIA’s vast network of contracted academic scientists — mainly psychiatrists, psychologists and neurologists who provided the “scientific” framework for psychological demolition — remained deeply hidden. The CIA deliberately kept Congress and the American people in the dark about its darkest illegal projects; it is a matter of conjecture how much the President of the U.S. during the 1950s through the mid-1970s knew about the nature of these infamous illegal activities. Most of the documents pertaining to CIA’s nefarious mind control projects were destroyed per instructions by Richard Helms in 1973, prior to a Congressional investigation of CIA’s criminal national activities. Some records were deliberately coded to confuse and others remain classified.
>
>It bears emphasizing that lurking within CIA’s abominable mind- manipulation projects was a strong element of racism. After all, these experiments were following the Nazi blueprint for experimentation on those deemed inferior undesirable outcasts. Nazi doctors and scientists who had been imported to the U.S. under Operation Paperclip carried over their belief in their own racial superiority, their unbridled hatred for Communism and their determination to prepare for a decisive victory in a war against the Soviet Union. They also transported their ruthless and immoral disregard for the rights and humanity of those they deemed inferior. They found sympathetic allies among high ranking intelligence officials within the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and its successor, the CIA who, like the Nazis held themselves and their mission above moral precepts.

1. [The Secret Life of Jim Jones: A Parapolitical Fugue](https://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=16572)
>What follows is an interim report about Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple. In so far as it has a central thesis, it is that the “mass-suicide” that took place at Jonestown in 1978 was, in reality, a massacre. It seems to me that this much can be proven by reference to the medical evidence—particularly the evidence collected by the Guyanese pathologist, Dr. Leslie Mootoo.
>
>The importance of this conclusion should be obvious. To suggest that hundreds of members of the Peoples Temple murdered their children and killed themselves is, in this writer’s view, a blood libel on those who died there. Indeed, it seems comparable to contending that because Jews worked in the concentration camps of Nazi Germany, and walked to their deaths in gas-chambers, they, too, committed “suicide.”
>
>A second argument put forward in these pages is that Jones instigated the massacre because he feared that Congressman Leo Ryan’s investigation would disgrace him. Specifically, Jones appears to have been terrified that Ryan and the press would uncover information that the leftist founder of the Peoples Temple was for many years a witting stooge, or agent, of the FBI and the CIA. This concern was, I believe, mirrored in various precincts of the U.S. intelligence community, where it was feared that Ryan’s investigation would embarrass the CIA by linking Jones to some of the Agency’s most volatile programs and operations.
>
>This may be why the cult-leader’s 201-file was purged by the CIA immediately after Jones’s friend, and suspected case-officer, Dan Mitrione, died.[1] And it may also be why Congressman Ryan’s contingent was escorted to Jonestown by the CIA’s undercover chief-of-station in Guyana, Richard Dwyer.[2]
>
>What I believe and what I can prove are, in some instances, two different things. There is no smoking gun in the pages that follow. But I think the reader will agree that there are certainly a great many empty cartridges lying about—enough, perhaps, to stimulate further investigation by others.
>
>That said, it must also be said that I am hardly the first to suggest that the Jonestown massacre was the outcome of someone’s secret machinations. The affair is inherently mysterious, and conspiracy theories abound—the most prominent among them that “Jonestown” was a CIA mind-control experiment.
>
>The view has been put forward in a number of venues. Congressman Ryan’s close friend and chief-of-staff, Joe Holsinger, is persuaded of it. The Edwin Mellen Press has even published a book on the subject, answering its titular question — Was Jonestown a CIA Medical Experiment? — in the affirmative.[3] By no means, finally, there is the work of well-intentioned conspiracists such as John Judge, one of the first writers to approach the story with as much skepticism as horror.

4. [The Penal Colony](https://www.transmissionsfromjonestown.com/research/the-penal-colony)
>In 1980 Joseph Holsinger testified in front of the house foreign affairs subcommittee stating that he believed that CIA operatives working at the US embassy in Georgetown had used Jim Jones and his settlement in a behavioral modification experiment. Holsinger claimed to have information from an unimpeachable source that a CIA agent was present during the assassination of congressman Ryan. He alleged that said agent was likely the deputy chief of missions to Guyana Richard Dwyer. Larry Layton’s defense attorney also pointed this out but was not allowed to question Richard Dwyer in court about his time in South America or his work for the CIA. 
>
>In his statement Holsinger claimed that an elaborate cover-up had been launched by the US government to conceal the truth about Jonestown. A Berkeley professor who had been involved with mind control projects had sent Joseph Holsinger a document called the Penal Colony. This document allegedly proved that the CIA had lied to congress about ending its mind control experiment studies and was in fact transferring resources and projects from institutions and prisons to religious groups. Joseph Holsinger speculated that MKUltra’s new focus was on cults and the CIA had worked with Jim Jones to experiment on the Peoples Temple.

>Notes from the Editors of the Jonestown Institute:
>
>Joe Holsinger presented the Penal Colony article during his 1980 presentation on “Psycho-Social Implications of the Jonestown Phenomenon.” According to Holsinger, the article was written in January 1979 by a Berkeley psychologist “who has asked that his name be withheld.” It is almost certain that the author is Richard Ofshe, a professor of social psychology at UC-Berkeley and an associate of Margaret Singer.

>The People's Temple commune at Jonestown was stocked with thousands of doses of dangerous drugs, smuggled into Guyana. Two survivors of the sect said at least some of the drugs were used to control those who might defect.
>
>A list of the drug inventory found in Jonestown shows large supplies of depressants. Survivors and law enforcement officials here said at least some of these were used to control the behavior of persons viewed as dangerous by the Rev. Jim Jones, the leader of the Temple.
>
>Included in the drug warehouse were Quaaludes, Demerol, Valium, morphine and 11,000 doses of Thorazine, a drug used to calm people with extreme mental problems.
>
>Checks with medical officials and medical journals produced a profile of drug supply that promoted suicidal tendencies, could cause hallucinations, blurred vision, confusion, speech disturbances, involuntary movements and emotional euphoria and depression.
>
>Since there were no records, it was impossiblelo determine how frequently or extensively the drugs were used.
>
>Perhaps Imposed Forcefully
>
>Visitors to Jonestown have reported there were indications that these drugs were used liberally, and perhaps imposed forcefully in some cases, in the hourslong mass killings and suicides in which more than 900 people died. Some had drunk punch laced with cyanide.
>
>The drug inventory, which has not been completed, is being made by brand names. It shows that the majority of the drugs were manufactured by United States concerns. They were smuggled into Guyana by members of the.People's Temple to avert this country's strict importation regulations on pharmaceuticals, officials said.
>
>Drugs bought for use in Guyana must be registered with and cleared through government agency. None of the drugs found in Jonestown were, according to officials in the drug industry here.
>
>Spokesmen for United States concerns that manufactured the drugs ,found at Jonestown denied any involvement.
>
>Dr. Joyce H. Lowinson, a psychiatrist and member of President Carter's Strategy Council on Drug Abuse Prevention, said the list of drugs from the People's Temple indicated “there were a lot of psychotic patients, or they were using them to control people.”
>
>Dale Parks, a nursing supervisor at Jonestown who is a trained therapist for respiratory ailments, said that he knew some of the drugs were used to control would‐be defectors in the commune's “extended care unit.” But he professed shock at the extent of the drugs found there, saying, “Oh, my God, I don't believe it.”
>
>Mr. Parks fled Jonestown on Nov. 18 with Representative Leo J. Ryan, a California Democrat who had been there on fact‐finding mission. A short time later, Mr. Ryan, three American newsmen and Mr. Parks's mother were slain at a remote airstrip.
>
>“Those are absolutely hard‐line, hardcore drugs,” Mr. Parks said when read partial inventory from Jonestown.
>
>“There's no way that many people were receiving treatment,” he said in reference to the amount of drugs found in Jonestown. “I know they were using things to keep people under control, but not like this.”
>
>Control Sessions Explained
>
>According to Mr. Parks, the control sessions took place in the extended‐care unit of the commune, which conissted of eight beds separated from the regular medical facilities.
>
>“If a person wanted to leave Jonestown or if there was a breach of rules, one was taken to the extended care unit,” he said. “It was a rehabilitation place, where one would be reintegrated back into the community. The people were given drugs tO keep them under control.”
>
>After a few days or weeks, the patients (lost their desire to leave and no further behavioral problems were anticipated, Mr. Parks said.
>
>Another former Jonestown resident, who refused to let his name be used, said, “People who wanted to leave were fed drugs like Thorazine.”
>
>Many of the drugs are habit‐forming, according to medical journals. Some are especially dangerous, according to the journals, and have precipitated unpredictable, severe and occasionally fatal reactions.

6. [The Black Hole of Guyana: The Untold Story of the Jonestown Massacre - Who Was Jim Jones?](https://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/JohnJudge/Jonestown.html#p3)
>Jim Jones grew up in Lynn, in southern Indiana. His father was an active member of the local Ku Klux Klan that infest that area.[77] His friends found him a little strange, and he was interested in preaching the Bible and religious rituals.[78] Perhaps more important was his boyhood friendship with Dan Mitrione, confirmed by local residents.[79] In the early 50s, Jones set out to be a religious minister, and was ordained at one point by a Christian denomination in Indianapolis.[80] It was during this period that he met and married his lifelong mate, Marceline.[81] He also had a small business selling monkeys, purchased from the research department at Indiana State University in Bloomington.[82]
>
>A Bible-thumper and faith healer, Jones put on revivalist tent shows in the area, and worked close to Richmond, Indiana. Mitrione, his friend, worked as chief of police there, and kept him from being arrested or run out of town.[83] According to those close to him, he used wet chicken livers as evidence of "cancers" he was removing by "divine powers."[84] His landlady called him "a gangster who used a Bible instead of a gun."[85] His church followers included Charles Beikman, a [Marine] who was to stay with him to the end.[86] Beikman was later charged with the murders of several Temple members in Georgetown, following the massacre.[87]
>
>Dan Mitrione, Jones' friend, moved on to the CIA-financed International Police Academy, where police were trained in counter-insurgency and torture techniques from around the world.[88] Jones, a poor, itinerant preacher, suddenly had money in 1961 for a trip to "minister" in Brazil, and he took his family with him.[89] By this time, he had "adopted" Beikman, and eight children, both Black and white.[90] His neighbors in Brazil distrusted him. He told them he worked with U.S. Navy Intelligence. His transportation and groceries were being provided by the U.S. Embassy as was the large house he lived in.[91] His son, Stephan, commented that he made regular trips to Belo Horizonte, site of the CIA headquarters in Brazil.[92] An American police advisor, working closely with the CIA at that point, Dan Mitrione was there as well.[93] Mitrione had risen in the ranks quickly, and was busy training foreign police in torture and assassination methods. He was later kidnapped by Tupermaro guerillas in Uruguay, interrogated and murdered.[94] Costa Gravas made a film about his death titled State of Siege.[95] Jones returned to the United States in 1963, with $10,000 in his pocket.[96] Recent articles indicate that Catholic clergy are complaining about CIA funding of other denominations for "ministry" in Brazil; perhaps Jones was an early example.[97]
>
>With his new wealth, Jones was able to travel to California and establish the first People's Temple in Ukiah, California, in 1965. Guarded by dogs, electric fences and guard towers, he set up Happy Havens Rest Home.[98] Despite a lack of trained personnel, or proper licensing, Jones drew in many people at the camp. He had elderly, prisoners, people from psychiatric institutions, and 150 foster children, often transferred to care at Happy Havens by court orders.[99] He was contacted there by Christian missionaries from World Vision, an international evangelical order that had done espionage work for the CIA in Southeast Asia.[100] He met "influential" members of the community and was befriended by Walter Heady, the head of the local chapter of the John Birch Society.[101] He used the members of his "church" to organize local voting drives for Richard Nixon's election, and worked closely with the republican party.[102] He was even appointed chairman of the county grand jury.[103]
>
>"The Messiah from Ukiah," as he was known then, met and recruited Timothy Stoen, a Stanford graduate and member of the city DA's office, and his wife Grace.[104] During this time, the Layton family, Terri Buford and George Phillip Blakey and other important members joined the Temple.[105] The camp "doctor," Larry Schacht, claims Jones got him off drugs and into medical school during this period.[106] These were not just street urchins. Buford's father was a Commander for the fleet at the Philadelphia Navy Base for years.[107] The Laytons were a well-heeled, aristocratic family. Dr. Layton donated at least a quarter-million dollars to Jones. His wife son and daughter were all members of the Temple.[108] George Blakey, who married Debbie Layton, was from a wealthy British family. He donated $60,000 to pay the lease on the 27,000-acre Guyana site in 1974.[109] Lisa Philips Layton had come to the U.S. from a rich Hamburg banking family in Germany.[110] Most of the top lieutenants around Jones were from wealthy, educated backgrounds, many with connections to the military or intelligence agencies. These were the people who would set up the bank accounts, complex legal actions, and financial records that put people under the Temple's control.[111]
>
>Stoen was able to set up important contacts for Jones as Assistant DA in San Francisco.[112] Jones changed his image to that of a liberal.[113] He had spent time studying the preaching methods of Fr. Divine in Philadelphia, and attempted to use them in a manipulative way on the streets of San Francisco. Fr. Divine ran a religious and charitable operation among Philadelphia's poor Black community.[114] Jones was able to use his followers in an election once again, this time for Mayor Moscone. Moscone responded in 1976, putting Jones in charge of the city Housing Commission.[115] In addition, many of his key followers got jobs with the city Welfare Department and much of the recruitment to the Temple in San Francisco came from the ranks of these unemployed and dispossessed people.[116] Jones was introduced to many influential liberal and radical people there, and entertained or greeted people ranging from Roslyn Carter to Angela Davis.[117]

7. [The Black Hole of Guyana: The Untold Story of the Jonestown Massacre - The Links to U.S. Intelligence Agencies](https://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/JohnJudge/Jonestown.html#p6)
>Our story so far has hinted at connections to U.S. intelligence, such as the long-term friendship of Jones and CIA associate Dan Mitrione. But the ties are much more direct when a full picture of the operation is revealed. To start with, the history of Forbes Burnham's rise to power in Guyana is fraught with the clear implication of a CIA coup d'état to oust troublesome independent leader Cheddi Jagan.[196] In addition, the press and other evidence indicated the presence of a CIA agent on the scene at the time of the massacre. This man, Richard Dwyer, was working as Deputy Chief of Mission for the U.S. Embassy in Guyana.[197] Identified in Who's Who in the CIA, he has been involved since 1959, and was last stationed in Martinique.[198] Present at the camp site and the airport strip, his accounts were used by the State Department to confirm the death of Leo Ryan. At the massacre, Jones said, "Get Dwyer out of here" just before the killings began.[199]
>
>Other Embassy personnel, who knew the situation at Jonestown well, were also connected to intelligence work. U.S. Ambassador John Burke, who served in the CIA with Dwyer in Thailand, was an Embassy official described by Philip Agee as working for the CIA since 1963. A Reagan appointee to the CIA, he is still employed by the Agency, usually on State Department assignments.[200] Burke tried to stop Ryan's investigation.[201] Also at the Embassy was Chief Consular officer Richard McCoy, described as "close to Jones," who worked for military intelligence and was "on loan" from the Defense Department at the time of the massacre.[202] According to a standard source, "The U.S. embassy in Georgetown housed the Georgetown CIA station. It now appears that the majority and perhaps all of the embassy officials were CIA officers operating under State Department covers . . ."[203] Dan Webber, who was sent to the site of the massacre the day after, was also named as CIA.[204] Not only did the State Department conceal all reports of violations at Jonestown from Congressman Leo Ryan, but the Embassy regularly provided Jones with copies of all congressional inquiries under the Freedom of Information Act.[205]
>
>Ryan had challenged the Agency's overseas operations before, as a member of the House Committee responsible for oversight on intelligence. He was an author of the controversial Hughes-Ryan Amendment that would have required CIA disclosure in advance to the congressional committees of all planned covert operations. The Amendment was defeated shortly after his death.[206]
>
>American intelligence agencies have a sordid history of cooperative relations with Nazi war criminals and international fascism.[207] In light of this, consider the curious ties of the family members of the top lieutenants to Jim Jones. The Layton family is one example. Dr. Laurence Layton was Chief of Chemical and Biological Warfare Research at Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, for many years, and later worked as Director of Missile and Satellite Development at the Navy Propellant Division, Indian Head, Maryland.[208] His wife, Lisa, had come from a rich German family. Her father, Hugo, had represented I.G. Farben as a stockbroker.[209] Her stories about hiding her Jewish past from her children for most of her life, and her parents' escape from a train heading for a Nazi concentration camp seem shallow, as do Dr. Layton's Quaker religious beliefs. The same family sent money to Jonestown regularly.[210] Their daughter, Debbie, met and married George Philip Blakey in an exclusive private school in England. Blakey's parents have extensive stock holdings in Solvay drugs, a division of the Nazi cartel I.G. Farben.[211] He also contributed financially.[212]
>
>Terri Buford's father, Admiral Charles T. Buford, worked with Navy Intelligence.[213] In addition, Blakey was reportedly running mercenaries from Jonestown to CIA-backed UNITA forces in Angola.[214] Maria Katsaris' father was a minister with the Greek Orthodox Church, a common conduit of CIA fundings, and Maris claimed she had proof he was CIA. She was shot in the head, and her death was ruled a suicide, but at one point Charles Beikman was charged with killing her.[215] On their return to the United States, the "official" survivors were represented by attorney Joseph Blatchford who had been named prior to that time in a scandal involving CIA infiltration of the Peace Corps.[216] Almost everywhere you look at Jonestown, U.S. intelligence and fascism rear their ugly heads.
>
>The connection of intelligence agencies to cults is nothing new. A simple but revealing example is the Unification Church, tied to both the Korean CIA (i.e., American CIA in Korea), and the international fascist network known as the World Anti-Communist League (WACL). The Moonies hosted WACL's first international conference.[217] What distinguished Jonestown was both the level of control and the openly sinister involvement. It was imperative that they cover their tracks.[218]
>
>Maria Katsaris sent Michael Prokes, Tim Carter, and another guard out at the last minute with $500,000 cash in a suitcase, and instructions for a drop point. Her note inside suggests the funds were destined for the Soviet Union.[219] Prokes later shot himself at a San Francisco press conference, where he claimed to be an FBI informant.[220] Others reported meeting with KGB agents and plans to move to Russia.[221] This disinformation was part of a "red smear" to be used if they had to abandon the operation. The Soviet Union had no interest in the money and even less in Jonestown. The cash was recovered by the Guyanese government.[222]
>
>Their hidden funding may include more intelligence links. A mysterious account in Panama, totaling nearly $5 million in the name of an "Associacion Pro Religiosa do San Pedro, S.A." was located.[223] This unknown Religious Association of St. Peter was probably one of the twelve phony companies set up by Archbishop Paul Marcinkus to hide the illegal investments of Vatican funds through the scandal-ridden Banco Ambrosiano.[224] A few days after the story broke about the accounts, the President of Panama, and most of the government resigned, Roberto Calvi of Banco Ambrosiano was murdered, and the Jonestown account disappeared from public scrutiny and court record.[225]
>
>The direct orders to cover up the cause of death came from the top levels of the American government. Zbigniew Brezezinsky delegated to Robert Pastor, and he in turn ordered Lt. Col. Gordon Sumner to strip the bodies of identity.[226] Pastor is now Deputy Director of the CIA.[227] One can only wonder how many others tied to the Jonestown operation were similarly promoted.

8. [Mark Lane (author) - Engagement and work for the Peoples Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lane_(author)#Engagement_and_work_for_the_Peoples_Temple)
>In 1978, Lane began to represent the Peoples Temple. Temple leader Jim Jones hired Lane and Donald Freed to help make the case of what it alleged to be a "grand conspiracy" by intelligence agencies against the Peoples Temple. Jones told Lane he wanted to "pull an Eldridge Cleaver", referring to the fugitive Black Panther who was able to return to the United States after repairing his reputation.[46]: 440 

>In September 1978, Lane visited Jonestown, spoke to Jonestown residents, provided support for the theory that intelligence agencies conspired against Jonestown and drew parallels between Martin Luther King Jr. and Jim Jones. Lane then held press conferences stating that "none of the charges" against the Temple "are accurate or true" and that there was a "massive conspiracy" against the Temple by "intelligence organizations," naming the CIA, FBI, FCC and the U.S. Post Office. Though Lane represented himself as disinterested, the Temple paid Lane $6,000 per month to help generate such theories.[46]: 440–441  Regarding the effect of the work of Lane and Freed upon Temple members, Temple member Annie Moore wrote that "Mom and Dad have probably shown you the latest about the conspiracy information that Mark Lane, the famous attorney in the ML King case and Don Freed the other famous author in the Kennedy case have come up with regarding activities planned against us—Peoples Temple."[47]: 282  Another Temple member, Carolyn Layton, wrote that Don Freed told them that "anything this drug out could be nothing less than conspiracy".[47]: 272 

9. [Mark Lane (author) - Jonestown_tragedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lane_(author)#Jonestown_tragedy)
>Lane was present in Jonestown during the evening of November 18, 1978, and witnessed or heard part of the events claiming at least 408 lives (out of a total recount of 915 carried out five days later); these events involved, up to some extent, murder suicide by cyanide poisoning and were compounded by the murder of Congressman Leo Ryan and four others at a nearby airstrip.[48] For months before that tragedy, Jones frequently created fear among members by stating that the CIA and other intelligence agencies were conspiring with "capitalist pigs" to destroy Jonestown and harm its members.[49] This included mentions of CIA involvement in the address Jones gave the day before the arrival of Congressman Ryan.[50]
>
>During the visit of Congressman Ryan, Lane helped represent the Temple along with its other attorney, Charles R. Garry, who was furious with Lane for holding numerous press conferences and alleging the existence of conspiracies against the Peoples Temple.[51] Garry was also displeased with Lane for making a veiled threat that the Temple might move to the Soviet Union in a letter to Congressman Ryan.[52]
>
>Late in the afternoon of November 18, two men wielding rifles approached Lane and Garry, who had earlier been sent to a small wooden house by Jones.[53] It is not clear whether the gunmen were sent to kill Lane and Garry, but one of the gunmen recognized Charles Garry as an attorney in a trial that the gunman had attended.[53] After a relatively friendly exchange, the men informed Garry and Lane that they were going to "commit revolutionary suicide" to "expose this racist and fascist society".[53] The gunmen then gave Garry and Lane directions to exit Jonestown.[53] Garry and Lane then sneaked into the jungle, where they hid and called a temporary truce while the tragedy unfolded.[54]
>
>On a tape made while members committed suicide by ingesting cyanide-poisoned punch, the reason given by Jones to commit suicide was consistent with Jones's previously stated conspiracy theories of intelligence organizations allegedly conspiring against the Temple, that men would "parachute in here on us", "shoot some of our innocent babies" and "they'll torture our children, they'll torture some of our people here, they'll torture our seniors".[55] Parroting Jones's prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to fascism, one temple member states, "[T]he ones that they take captured, they're gonna just let them grow up and be dummies".[55] Annie Moore and Carolyn Layton were among the 900 who died.

10. [Mark Lane (author) - After the tragedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lane_(author)#After_the_tragedy)
>Lane later wrote a book about the tragedy, The Strongest Poison.[56] Lane reported hearing automatic weapon fire, and presumes that U.S. forces killed Jonestown survivors.[57] While Lane blames Jones and Peoples Temple leadership for the deaths at Jonestown, he also claims that U.S. officials exacerbated the possibility of violence by employing agents provocateurs.[57] For example, Lane claimed that Temple attorney (and later defector) Timothy Stoen, who, Lane alleged, had repeatedly prompted the Temple to take radical action before defecting, "had evidently led three lives", one of those being a government informant or agent.[58]

>A few days later I received a call at my office from a man who asked if I would meet with him to discuss the Peoples Temple. I found the request very curious; I said o.k. and we met the next day in a Stockton restaurant. The man told me his name was Gary Jackson. I asked him what he did and he said that he worked for the government, but I couldn’t get him to be more specific. He asked what prompted my interest in Peoples Temple. I asked him how he knew that I was interested in the Temple. He paused for a few moments, then said something to the effect – “There are ways if you think about it.” The answer was obvious – Jim Jones’ phone was tapped.\

>He said if I could be successful at joining the Temple full-time as a staff member and report regularly on what was going on inside the organization, he would arrange for me to be paid $200 a week.\

>I could no longer justify informing on Jones and his organization. During my next contact, I told Jackson what I thought of Jones and he desperately tried to convince me I was wrong. [...] He urged me not to tell Jones about him and I told him I saw no reason why I should do that unless I suspected someone else was taking my place.

>Later in 1992, Basayev traveled to Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia, to assist the local separatist movement against the Georgian government's attempts to regain control of the region. Basayev became the commander-in-chief of the forces of the Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus (a volunteer unit of pan-Caucasian nationalists, people from the Caucasus). Their involvement was crucial in the Abkhazian war and in October 1993 the Georgian government suffered a decisive military defeat. It was rumored that the volunteers were trained and supplied by some part of the Russian army's GRU military intelligence service. According to The Independent journalist Patrick Cockburn, "cooperation between Mr Basayev and the Russian army is not so surprising as it sounds. In 1992–93 he is widely believed to have received assistance from the GRU when he and his brother Shirvani fought in Abkhazia, a breakaway part of Georgia." No specific evidence was given.[18]
>
>The Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta reported that Basayev was an agent of GRU, and another publication by journalist Boris Kagarlitsky said that "It is maintained, for example, that Shamil Basayev and his brother Shirvani are long-standing GRU agents, and that all their activities were agreed, not with the radical Islamists, but with the generals sitting in the military intelligence offices. All the details of the attack by Basayev's detachments were supposedly worked out in the summer of 1999 in a villa in the south of France with the participation of Basayev and the Head of the Presidential administration, Aleksandr Voloshin. Furthermore, it is alleged that the explosive materials used were not supplied from secret bases in Chechnya but from GRU stockpiles near Moscow."[19][20] The Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta stated that the Basayev brothers "both recruited as agents by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian General Staff (GRU) in 1991–92." The Russian newspaper Versiya published the GRU file on Basayev and his brother, which revealed that "both Chechen terrorists were named as regular agents of the military intelligence organization."[21] In a July 2020 interview, the former Russian Federal Security Service chief Sergei Stepashin admitted that Basayev cooperated with military intelligence while fighting against Georgian government in Abkhazia.[22]
>
>Russian special forces joined with the Chechens under Basayev to attack Georgia. A GRU agent, Anton Surikov, had extensive connections with Basayev.[23] Russian military intelligence had ordered Basayev to support the Abkhaz.[24]

>Basayev received direct military training from the GRU since the Abkhaz were backed by Russia. Other Chechens also were trained by the GRU in warfare, many of these Chechens who fought for the Russians in Abkhazia against Georgia had fought for Azerbaijan against Armenia in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War.[25]

2. [Shamil Basayev - War crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamil_Basayev#War_crimes)
>According to Paul J. Murphy, "Russian military intelligence turned a blind eye to the 1991 terrorist arrest warrant against Basayev to train him and his detachment in Abkhazia, and the Russians even helped direct Basayev's combat operations" and "long after the war, Basayev praised the professionalism and courage of his Russian trainers in Abkhazia – praise that led some of his enemies in Grozny, even President Maskhadov, to later call him a "longtime GRU agent".[27][28]
>
>In 1993, Basayev lead the KNK corps, this unit under Basayev carried out war crimes in Georgia, decapitating Georgian civilians.[29] According to the newspaper "Free Georgia" Chechens and other northern Caucasians rounded up captured soldiers and civilians at the local stadium and executed them. Some were decapitated and their heads were used to play football. After a commission composed of Russian deputies, as well as a commission of Michael van Praag went to Gagra and did not confirm the fact of such a brutal attitude towards the Georgians, this newspaper admitted in November that "the episode at the stadium was not confirmed".[30]

>Few authoritative accounts of Basayev's life after Abkhazia exist. Some sources claim that after Abkhazia, Basayev moved to Chechnya and became a successful entrepreneur in the Chechen mafia, organizing train-car theft and drug dealing networks. According to Basayev himself, millions of dollars were donated to him by unnamed foreign businessmen from the Chechen diaspora.[31]
>
>Having already been noticed in Afghanistan, where he fought as a young man, and then in Abkhazia in Georgia, Basayev would further attract the attention of Pakistan's premier intelligence agency, the ISI : under Pakistani command, and after meeting many powerful personalities of the army, including the DG ISI Javed Ashraf Qazi, he would be one of the 1,500-strong Afghan mujahideen contingent which fought the Armenians during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and in April 1994, the ISI would eventually arrange "a refresher course for Basayev and some of his NCOs in guerrilla warfare and Islamic learning in the Amir Munawid Camp in Khost province in Afghanistan", with Basayev also having further specialized training in Pakistan proper, in cities like Rawalpindi, Peshawar and Muridke, near Lahore. They were also given Stingers, anti-tank rockets and advanced explosives, which would be later used to shoot down Russian combat airplanes and dozens of helicopters. Ultimately, hundreds of Chechens would be trained in Khost, under the ISI as well as the Pakistan-based Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Ansar, and one of its commanders, Abu Abdullah Jaffa, once in Pakistan's Northern Light Infantry, would work closely with Basayev over the years, as for instance he's supposed to be the one who planned the invasion of Dagestan.[32]

>According to David Satter, Yuri Felshtinsky, Alexander Litvinenko, Vladimir Pribylovsky and Boris Kagarlitsky, the bombings were a successful false flag operation coordinated by the Russian state security services to win public support for a new full-scale war in Chechnya and to bring Putin to power.[204][16][17][18][66][205][19][206][207] Some of them described the bombings as typical "active measures" practised by the KGB in the past. The war in Chechnya boosted Prime Minister and former FSB Director Vladimir Putin's popularity, and brought the pro-war Unity Party to the State Duma and Putin to the presidency within a few months.
>
>During the testimony of David Satter in the United States House of Representatives, he stated that:
>
>>With Yeltsin and his family facing possible criminal prosecution, however, a plan was put into motion to put in place a successor who would guarantee that Yeltsin and his family would be safe from prosecution and the criminal division of property in the country would not be subject to reexamination. For "Operation Successor" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early. Putin was elected president and his first act was to guarantee Yeltsin immunity from prosecution.[208]
>
>According to a reconstruction of the events by Felshtinsky and Pribylovsky:[209]
>
>The bombings in Buynaksk were carried out by a team of twelve GRU officers who were sent to Dagestan and supervised by the head of GRU's 14th Directorate General Nikolai Kostechko. That version was partly based on a testimony by Aleksey Galkin. The bombing in Buynaksk was conducted by the GRU to avoid an "interagency conflict between the FSB and the Ministry of Defense".
>
>In Moscow, Volgodonsk and Ryazan, the attacks were organized by the FSB through a chain of command that included director of the counter-terrorism department General German Ugryumov, FSB operatives Maxim Lazovsky, Vladimir Romanovich, Ramazan Dyshekov and others. Achemez Gochiyayev, Tatyana Korolyeva, and Alexander Karmishin rented warehouses that received shipments of hexogen disguised as sugar and did not know that the explosives were delivered.
>
>Adam Dekkushev, Krymshamkhalov, and Timur Batchayev were recruited by FSB agents who presented themselves as "Chechen separatists" to deliver explosives to Volgodonsk and Moscow.

>Names and the fate of FSB agents who planted the bomb in the city of Ryazan remain unknown.

>On the evening of September 22, 1999, several residents of an apartment block in Ryazan, a city about a hundred miles south of Moscow, observe three strangers at the entrance of their building. The two young men and a woman are carrying large sacks into the basement. The residents notice that the car’s plate has been partially covered with paper, although they can still see a Moscow license plate number underneath. They decide to call the local police. After several bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow earlier in the month (see September 9, 1999 and September 13, 1999), their vigilance is understandable. When the police arrive, around 9:00 p.m., they uncover what appears to be huge bomb: three sacks of sugar filled with a granular powder, connected to a detonator and a timing device set for 5:30 a.m. The bomb squad uses a gas testing device to confirm that it is explosive material: it appears to be hexagen, the military explosive that is believed to have been used to blow up two Moscow blocks. The residents are evacuated. Then the bomb carted away and turned over to the FSB. (In an apparent oversight, the FSB fails to collect the detonator, which is photographed by the local police.) The following morning, September 23, the government announces that a terrorist attack has been averted. They praise the vigilance of the local people and the Ryazan police. Police comb the city and find the suspects’ car. A telephone operator for long-distance calls reports that she overheard a suspicious conversation: the caller said there were too many police to leave town undetected and was told, “Split up and each of you make your own way out.” To the police’s astonishment, the number called belongs to the FSB. Later this day, the massive manhunt succeeds: the suspects are arrested. But the police are again stunned when the suspects present FSB credentials. On Moscow’s orders, they are quietly released. On September 24, the government reverses itself and now says the bomb was a dummy and the whole operation an exercise to test local vigilance. The official announcement is met with disbelief and anger. Ryazan residents, thousands of whom have had to spend the previous night outdoors, are outraged; local authorities protest that they were not informed. However, the suspicion of a government provocation is not widely expressed and press coverage fades after a few days. It is only several months later that an investigation by the independent weekly Novaya Gazeta re-ignites the controversy (see February 20, 2000 and Fall 1999). The government’s explanations will fail to convince skeptics (see March 23, 2000). The Ryazan incident later becomes the main reason for suspecting the government of having orchestrated previous bombings. The controversy is then widely reported in the international press.

On September 22, 1999, a bomb was discovered in the city of Ryazan, about 100 miles south of Moscow. After the chief bomb suspects were discovered to be FSB agents, the government claimed the bomb was a dummy and the incident was a training exercise (see September 22-24, 1999). But the bomb-squad officer, Yuri Tkachenko, is adamant that it was a professionally-prepared, military-style bomb. He defends the accuracy of his sophisticated gas-testing device which identified the explosives as hexogen. The article provokes much comment in Russia but is ignored by the government.

The contents of the memo, which additionally suggests Saudi complicity in the attacks, are supported by the connections recently uncovered by Sri Lankan authorities, that the alleged ringleader of the bombings, Zahran Hashim, had to Saudi Arabia.
>
>The document carries the Islamic calendar (Hijri) date of 11/8/1440, which equates to April 17, 2019 in the Gregorian calendar — just a few days before the bombings — and is addressed to the Saudi ambassador to Sri Lanka, Abdul Nasser bin Hussein al-Harethi, and authored by Saudi Foreign Minister Ibrahim bin Abdul Aziz al-Assaf. It carries the labels “urgent” and “top secret.”

>The brief memo states the following (translated from Arabic):
>>
>>His Excellency Ambassador Abdul Nasser bin Hussein al-Harethi
>>
>>You should carry out the following measures immediately:
>
>>First: You should delete all documents, computer data and latest correspondence with domestic and foreign members and groups, in addition to imposing a curfew for the embassy personnel unless [travel] is necessary;
>>
>>Second: You should inform all those related to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia — including counselors, security forces and intelligence during the three coming days, especially on the Christian Easter Day — to avoid presence in public and crowded places, namely churches;
>>
>>Third: You should send written news about the Sri Lankan authorities and their viewpoints regularly to this ministry
>>
>>Ibrahim bin Abdul Aziz al-Assaf
>>
>>Foreign Minister
>>
>The memo, seen here, carries the seal of Saudi Arabia, conforms with the format of other leaked Saudi diplomatic memos, and carries two watermarks. MintPress was unable to obtain a copy for independent confirmation of its authenticity.
>
>The contents of the memo from the Saudi foreign minister to the Saudi ambassador to Sri Lanka, particularly its indication of prior knowledge of danger in crowded places and churches on Easter Sunday, have taken on a new significance following the arrest last Friday of Mohamed Aliyar, a 60-year-old, Saudi-educated Wahhabi scholar who operated the Center for Islamic Guidance in Zahran Hashim’s hometown of Kattankudy. According to a plaque outside of the Wahhabi religious center operated by Aliyar, the center is funded by unnamed Saudi and Kuwaiti donors.
>
>A statement released by Sri Lankan police stated that “Information has been revealed that the suspect arrested [Mohamed Aliyar] had a close relationship with … Zahran and had been operating financial transactions” on his behalf and was also “involved” in the training of the suicide bombers responsible for the massacres on Easter Sunday.
>
>A group of board members of the center, who spoke to the South China Morning Post prior to Aliyar’s arrest, stated that the center was funded by “local donations, student fees, and private donors who were classmates of Aliyar’s in Riyadh;” denounced Zahran Hashim as a “troublemaker;” and could not recall having seen him at the center recently. However, the police statement that followed Aliyar’s arrest suggested that his relationship with Zahran Hashim was not a part of his public persona.
>
>Of key interest in the police statement is the mention of Aliyar’s operating of “financial transactions” on Zahran Hashim’s behalf in the lead-up to the attacks. Several reports, such as this one from the BBC, noted that the attacks “required detailed planning, safe houses, an extensive network of planners and handlers, expertise on bomb-making, and significant funding.” Aliyar’s connections to wealthy Saudi donors and to Zahran suggest that he may have been a liaison for much of that funding.
>
>In addition, the leaked memo’s instruction for the Saudi ambassador to “delete all documents, computer data and latest correspondence with domestic and foreign members and groups,” suggests that the Saudi Embassy in Sri Lanka may have been aware or party to these or other transactions related to the Zahran-led attacks.
>
>While it is possible that funding had come from elsewhere, the fact that Zahran’s sister, Mohammad Hashim Madaniya, had been sent 2 million Sri Lankan rupees (around $12,000) from Zahran just days before the blast suggests that the amount of money involved in funding this operation was significant indeed and likely of foreign origin.

>He came to the United States working as a translator for Ayman al-Zawahiri who toured California in 1993 following the World Trade Centre bombing, hoping to raise money for al-Jihad from the numerous Islamic charities that still existed from the days of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. While there, Zawahiri encouraged him to infiltrate the United States, claiming to be defecting to the United States. When he simply walked into the CIA office in Cairo and asked to speak to the station chief to offer his services, the Americans assumed he was an Egyptian spy, but nevertheless recruited him to be a junior intelligence officer.[3] When tasked to infiltrate a mosque with ties to Hezbollah, he instead informed the imam he was an American spy intending to collect information. Another loyal American spy was also in the congregation and he reported Mohamed to the CIA, which dismissed him and sought to ban him from entering the United States.[3] However, he later enlisted in the U.S. Army Special Forces, who sent him to the Special Warfare school and encouraged him to pursue a doctorate in Islamic Studies to teach courses on the Middle East.[3]

>In the 1980s, Mohamed trained anti-Soviet fighters en route to Afghanistan. FBI special agent Jack Cloonan called him "bin Laden's first trainer".[4] Mohamed was charged with the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. In October 2000, he pleaded guilty to five counts of conspiracy to kill nationals of the United States and to destroy U.S. property.

One article will reveal that in early 1997, Fazul brought three more al-Qaeda operatives, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, Abdallah Nacha, and Mohamed al-Owhali, into Kenya. All three were also working with Mercy International, but were on temporary loan to Help Africa People. All of them will go on to play important roles in the embassy bombings. [DAILY NATION, 8/2/2008; DAILY NATION, 8/2/2008] From late 1996 until the embassy bombings, minus a few months near the start of 1998, US intelligence is monitoring two phone numbers at Mercy International’s Kenya office (see Late 1996-August 20, 1998), so it seems probable that the US would be aware of these men. In 1999, it will be alleged that the US-based Mercy International is actually a CIA front (see 1989 and After).

>The 1999 book Dollars for Terror will allege that in 1989, Mercy International, a “subsidiary of the Muslim Brotherhood, was able to establish its headquarters in the United States, in the state of Michigan, with the assistance of the CIA. The Agency provided significant logistical and financial support to this ‘humanitarian’ organization, enabling it to act clandestinely in the various Balkan conflicts as well as within the Muslim communities of several Russian republics.” [LABEVIERE, 1999, PP. 364] Mercy International will later be tied to al-Qaeda in a number of ways. For instance, in the mid-1990s its Pakistan branch will be headed by Zahid Shaikh Mohammed, brother of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (see 1988-Spring 1995). [LOS ANGELES TIMES, 9/1/2002] Its Kenya branch will be tied to the 1998 US embassy bombing there. Its Philippine branch is tied to Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, bin Laden’s brother-in-law. [BURR AND COLLINS, 2006, PP. 128, 188-189] Branches of this charity in different countries have slightly different names such as Mercy International-USA and Mercy International Relief Agency, and it has been claimed that the US branch has no connection with the terrorism-related branches. However, a 2003 article will draw links between the US branch and other branches. [NATIONAL REVIEW, 9/4/2003]

>Wadih Elias el-Hage[2] (Arabic: وديع الحاج, Wadī‘ al-Ḥāj) (born July 25, 1960) is Lebanese, and naturalized American citizen, who is serving life imprisonment in the United States based on conspiracy charges for the 1998 United States embassy bombings. Born to a Maronite Catholic family, El-Hage converted to Islam while still in Lebanon in the 1970s. He emigrated to the United States, where he developed an interest in militant interpretations of Islamic theology while attending the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.
>
>During the Soviet–Afghan War el-Hage traveled to Pakistan to work for a Saudi charity, returning to the US in 1985. He married 18 year old April Ray, an American citizen who had recently converted to Islam, gaining American citizenship in 1989.[3] Struggling financially, he decided to move his family to Quetta, Pakistan, but returned to run the Al Kifah Refugee Center in Brooklyn after the death of Mustafa Shalabi. While running the al-Kifah Refugee Center he met some of the extremists involved in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. At the time of their trial, he was in Sudan working as a secretary for Osama Bin Laden. In 1996 and 1997, after Bin Laden left Sudan for Afghanistan, el Hage worked in Nairobi, Kenya. Under the pretense of doing charity work, he organized the al-Qaeda network that planned the carried out the embassy bombing in Nairobi.[4]
>
>El-Hage was indicted[5] and arrested in 1998, and convicted on all counts and sentenced[6] to life without parole in 2001. His sentence was overturned in 2008 because it was based on federal mandatory sentencing guidelines invalidated by the US Supreme Court in 2005.[7] He was re-sentenced to life without parole in 2013.[8] El-Hage and his co-defendants are currently in the supermax prison known as ADX Florence.[9]

According to an unnamed Indonesian security official, former Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Dedy Masrukhin says he regrets the loss of life, but will not disclose who ordered him to make the bomb. He was discharged from the military in September 2001 for involvement in a drug case. He received explosives training in the US while he was still in the military.

>Officials say David Coleman Headley slipped through the cracks despite repeated warnings to U.S. law enforcement. Indian authorities think the U.S. knew more than it has revealed about the ex-informant’s activities before the 2008 siege that killed 166 people, including six U.S. citizens. Both scenarios suggest breakdowns in counterterror systems.

>
>It was not the first time American law enforcement authorities were warned about Mr. Headley, a longtime informer in Pakistan for the United States Drug Enforcement Administration whose roots in Pakistan and the United States allowed him to move easily in both worlds.

3. [David Headley - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Headley)
>David Coleman Headley (born Daood Sayed Gilani; 30 June 1960) is an American terrorist. He is currently serving a 35-year sentence in the United States after pleading guilty to 12 international terrorism charges.[2][3]
>
>It has been alleged that Headley made periodic trips to Pakistan for Lashkar-e-Taiba training while simultaneously working as an informant for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), but this is disputed.[4][5] Under the direction of Lashkar chiefs, Headley performed five spying missions in Mumbai to scout targets for the attacks, which killed 168 people. The following year, he performed a similar mission in Copenhagen to help plan an attack against the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, which had published cartoons of Muhammad. He was arrested at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago while on his way to Pakistan in October 2009.[4][6]
>
>U.S. authorities gave Indian investigators direct access to Headley,[7] but some in India have questioned why the U.S. had not shared suspicions about him with Indian authorities before the Mumbai attacks.[8] At the trial of Tahawwur Hussain Rana, an alleged co-conspirator, Headley gave detailed information about the participation of Pakistan's Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in carrying out the attacks.[9][10] Since his arrest and guilty plea, Headley has cooperated with U.S. and Indian authorities and given information about his associates.[11][12][13][14] On 24 January 2013, a U.S. federal court sentenced Headley to 35 years in prison for his role in the Mumbai attacks.
>
>Headley was prosecuted by a Mumbai special court in early February 2016, via a video link from his prison cell in the United States. He was prosecuted by special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam, the same lawyer who represented the state during the Mumbai attack trials.

4. [David Headley - Name change and ISI recruitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Headley#Name_change_and_ISI_recruitment)
>By 2005, Gilani's training had advanced to the point where he wanted to fight in Kashmir. Instead, Gilani was referred to Sajid Mir, LeT's foreign recruiter. Under Mir's direction, Gilani went to Philadelphia and legally changed his name to David Coleman Headley, taking his mother's surname. Even though Pennsylvania law requires a background check for name changes, state officials apparently did not uncover Headley's previous drug convictions. The name change would make it easier for Headley to hide his Pakistani ancestry and pass as a Westerner, leading anyone he encountered to assume he was a tourist.[29]
>
>In January 2006, Headley established ties with Adbur Rehman Hashim "Pasha" Syed, a retired Pakistan Army major and LeT militant, who put him in touch with Major Iqbal, a mysterious figure who is believed to have coordinated LeT activity through his capacity as an ISI officer. Under sworn testimony, Headley recalled meeting Iqbal and his superior, a Pakistani colonel, in a safe house. Iqbal and Mir reportedly became Headley's ISI handlers and oversaw his training in espionage techniques in preparation for a reconnaissance mission to Mumbai; he met with Iqbal and Mir separately so that the ISI could maintain plausible deniability. In February, Headley was again detained by border inspectors at John F. Kennedy International Airport after returning from Pakistan, and was again released. That month, he contacted his former DEA handler for the final time.[29]

5. [David Headley - Trips to Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Headley#Trips_to_Mumbai)
>Over the course of 2007, LeT's plot for the Mumbai attacks started to materialize, and the Western-looking Headley was considered the ideal militant to perform reconnaissance missions. Using $25,000 supplied to him by Iqbal, Headley opened a Mumbai branch office for Tahawwur Rana's immigration business—which Headley had already used to traffic heroin—as a front company.[33] Between 2007 and 2008, Headley made five trips to Mumbai, scouting local landmarks where LeT terrorists would carry out the multi-pronged attack. Headley stayed at the Taj Palace Hotel—identified by Iqbal and Mir as their main target—and surveyed the building using his ISI training, shooting hours of video during in-house tours.[citation needed]
>
>Iqbal and Mir were emboldened by Headley's intelligence and decided to make their attack more ambitious in scale. As they expanded their list of targets, Headley scouted the Oberoi Trident Hotel, the Leopold Cafe, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. When LeT decided to target the Nariman House, a Jewish community center, Headley visited the location posing as a Jew.[34] Headley also took boat tours to look for places where the attackers could reach the city through the waterfront; he found a landing location at a fishermen's slum in the Colaba area of southern Mumbai, where he gathered GPS coordinates. For the maritime reconnaissance, Headley received assistance from a frogman in the Pakistan Navy.
>
>Headley lived the high life during his time in Mumbai, and developed a rapport with the very people he was planning to help attack.[citation needed] He joined an upscale gym, frequented nightclubs, and befriended Rahul Bhatt, the son of Bollywood director Mahesh Bhatt, who guided him through the city's party scene. During his stay at the Taj Hotel, Headley acquainted himself with the hotel's staff, reportedly praising the building's architecture. In Colaba, he reportedly tried to attract a young café proprietor.[citation needed]

6. [David Headley - Indian suspicion about U.S. relationship with Headley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Headley#Indian_suspicion_about_U.S._relationship_with_Headley)
>While government officials in India cite full cooperation by U.S. authorities, the opposition parties and others in India have demanded explanations of why Headley was allowed to travel freely for years between India, Pakistan, and the U.S., and why he was working undercover for the DEA. Some Indian analysts have speculated that David Headley was a double agent for the Central Intelligence Agency that had infiltrated LeT,[50] an accusation denied by the CIA.[51] As soon as Headley was arrested in Chicago, the Indian media had a barrage of questions for the government about him, whose answers were slow in coming. Among other questions, Indian investigators wanted the FBI to share its tapes of Headley's communications with his Pakistani handlers to match with the voices taped on cell phones during the 2008 Mumbai attacks.[52]
>
>Following intense coverage and speculation in the Indian press, U.S. ambassador Timothy J. Roemer in April 2010 told reporters in New Delhi that the United States was working at the "highest level" to provide India access to Headley, even as it was passing along answers to questions in "real time".[53]
>
>News reports in October 2010 revealed that U.S. authorities had much advance knowledge about Headley's terrorist associations and activities. Headley's American and Moroccan wives had contacted American authorities in 2005 and 2007, respectively, complaining about his terrorist activities. The Moroccan wife told reporters that she had even shown the U.S. embassy in Islamabad photographs of their stay at the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai, warning them that he was doing something on behalf of Lashkar-e-Taiba.[54]
>
>Since Headley's guilty plea, Home Minister P. Chidambaram was repeatedly asked why the U.S. cannot extradite Headley to India. Analysts in some media outlets have speculated that the United States conspired to have Headley work undercover despite knowledge that he was involved in terrorism.[55][56]

>
>The recruits went through the following stages of training, according to Indian and US media reports:
>
>>Psychological: Indoctrination to Islamist Jihadi ideas, including imagery of atrocities suffered by Muslims in India,[55] Chechnya, Palestine and across the globe.
>>
>>Basic Combat: Lashkar's basic combat training and methodology course, the Daura Aam.
>>
>>Advanced Training: Selected to undergo advanced combat training at a camp near Mansehra, a course the organisation calls the Daura Khaas.[55] According to an unnamed source at the US Defense Department this includes advanced weapons and explosives training supervised by former members of the Pakistan Army,[27] along with survival training and further indoctrination.
>>
>>Commando Training: Finally, an even smaller group selected for specialized commando tactics training and marine navigation training given to the Fedayeen unit selected in order to target Mumbai.[56]
>>
>From the recruits, ten were handpicked for the Mumbai mission.[57] They also received training in swimming and sailing, besides the use of high-end weapons and explosives under the supervision of LeT commanders. According to a media report citing an unnamed former Defence Department Official of the US, the intelligence agencies of the US had determined that former officers from Pakistan's Army and Inter-Services Intelligence agency assisted actively and continuously in training.[27] They were given blueprints of all the four targets – The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Oberoi Trident, Nariman House and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus.

>The Duma refused to consider a proposal by the liberal democratic Union of Rightist Forces party to form an investigative commission charged with probing the government's actions in the theater siege.
>
>An independent investigation of the event was undertaken by Russian politicians Sergei Yushenkov, Sergei Kovalev, journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Hoover Institute scholar John B. Dunlop, and former FSB officers Aleksander Litvinenko and Mikhail Trepashkin. According to their version, the FSB knew about the terrorist group's arrival in Moscow and directed them to the theater through their agent provocateur Khanpasha Terkibayev ("Abu Bakar"), whose name was in the list of hostage takers and who left the theater alive.[53][88][89][90] In April 2003 Litvinenko gave information about Terkibayev ("the Terkibayev file") to Sergei Yushenkov when he visited London. Yushenkov passed this file to Politkovskaya and she was able to interview Terkibayev in person.[91] A few days later, Yushenkov was assassinated by gunfire in Moscow. Terkibayev was later killed in an apparent car crash in Chechnya.
>
>In June 2003, Litvinenko stated in an interview with the Australian television programme Dateline, that two of the Chechen militants involved in the siege—whom he named "Abdul the Bloody" and "Abu Bakar"—were working for the FSB, and that the agency manipulated the terrorists into staging the attack.[92] Litvinenko said: "[w]hen they tried to find [Abdul the Bloody and Abu Bakar] among the rotting corpses of dead terrorists, they weren't there. The FSB got its agents out. So the FSB agents among Chechens organized the whole thing on FSB orders, and those agents were released".[93] "Abu Bakar" (presumably Terkibayev) was also described as an FSB agent and organizer of the theater siege by Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Khinshtein and other journalists.[94][95][96][97][98][99] Sanobar Shermatova and a co-author had pointed out in "Moskovskie novosti" that Terkibaev had for a number of years been involved in "anti-Wahhabi" activities.[100]
>
>John Dunlop identifies "Abu Bakar" as Ruslan Elmurzaev, claimed by Mikhail Trepaskin to have been a resident of Moscow, not Chechnya, and to have been involved in various criminal activities operating out of the Hotel Salyut in Moscow. There were reports that Elmurzaev had not been killed in the storming of the theater. Film director Sergei Govorukhin, one of the volunteer negotiators at Dubrovka, has said that he is convinced that Elmurzaev, who he identified as an FSB agent, is still alive. Russian prosecutors were unable to show Elmurzaev's corpse and during a visit to Chechnya in October 2003, Russian intelligence officers confirmed to him that Elmurzaev was alive and well and living in Chechnya.[101]
>
>The titular leader of the hostage takers was one Movsar Baraev, the nephew of the late and infamous "wahhabi" kidnapper Arbi Baraev, a figure reported to have shadowy connections to both the FSB and GRU. In January 2003, the French journalist Anne Nivat reported that Baraev had been arrested two months before the hostage-taking incident. This information being true, Baraev was already in Russian custody when the theater siege occurred. Nivat also reported that two of the female hostage takers were also in Russian custody at the time of the siege while late Duma Deputy Yurii Shchekochikhin wrote that another female hostage taker was in custody at the time.[101]
>
>That "Abu Bakar" was in control and not Baraev was supported by an article in "Moskovskie novosti" by journalists Shermatova and Teit, in which it was reported that a hushed conversation between Abu Bakar and Baraev had been accidentally captured by NTV. Baraev declared that the hostage takers had been sent by Shamil Basaev only to be quietly corrected by Abu Bakar to add 'Aslan Maskhadov', in order to link the latter to the hostage taking.[100]
>
>There is also the figure of Arman Menkeev, a retired major in the GRU and a specialist in making explosive devices. He was arrested by the Interior Ministry in November 2002 at the Moscow Oblast base allegedly used by the terrorists but was released shortly afterwards. He may have subsequently been rearrested but was not charged with a crime and is apparently not in custody. FSB officers, who interrogated Menkeev in Lefortovo prison, classified him as "loyal to the Russian government", adding that "He knows how to keep a military and state secret".[101] The plastic explosive used by the terrorists was in fact "imitation plastic explosives" which had a "Ministry of Defense origin". The Moscow City Prosecutor's Office claimed that Menkeev could have been the source of this material.[102] Apart from two suicide belts, which were more of a danger to the wearers, the bombs placed in the theater (and elsewhere in Moscow prior to the siege) lacked essential elements like batteries; this provided the required conditions for the successful storming of the theater.[101]
>
>As evidence against Maskhadov, Russians cited a tape first shown on Al Jazeera and subsequently on Russian television, although only a fragment of the original tape was shown on Russian TV. On the original full length tape it was evident that it had been made in late summer, not in October, and had concerned a military operation against federal forces, not an act of hostage taking.[100] Nevertheless, Maskhadov had been discredited although there is no credible evidence to link him with the siege. In the end, it could be said that both the Russian government and the Chechen extremists had achieved their goals; talk of negotiations had ended and Maskhadov's reputation had been damaged.[101]

2. [Arbi Barayev - Second Chechen War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbi_Barayev#Second_Chechen_War)
>Following the Russian occupation of most of Chechnya, Barayev freely lived in Alkhan-Kala and frequently passed through Russian Army checkpoints without any problems, using identity papers of an FSB officer, and was also not included in the lists of people wanted "for participation in illegal armed groups".[13] Once arrested, Barayev was said to be instantly released by the demand of Beslan Gantamirov, then the leading figure in the pro-Moscow government.[15] In May 2000, the Russian military intelligence GRU officer leaked papers about Barayev's affiliation with FSB to a Chechen journalist.[7] In April 2001, Barayev's men allegedly ambushed and killed Viktor Popkov, a Russian dissident working in Chechnya as an aid worker and human rights activist since 1995, in the close vicinity of a military roadblock.[16]

>McVeigh was a top-scoring gunner with the 25mm cannon of the Bradley Fighting Vehicles used by the 1st Infantry Division and was promoted to sergeant. After being promoted, McVeigh earned a reputation of assigning undesirable work to black servicemen and using racial slurs.[1] He was stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas, before being deployed on Operation Desert Storm.

>In an interview before his execution, McVeigh said that he hit an Iraqi tank more than 500 yards away on his first day in the war and then the Iraqis surrendered. He also decapitated an Iraqi soldier with cannon fire from 1,100 yards away. He said he was later shocked to see carnage on the road while leaving Kuwait City after U.S. troops routed the Iraqi Army. McVeigh received several service awards, including the Bronze Star Medal,[22][page needed][1] National Defense Service Medal,[23] Southwest Asia Service Medal,[24] Army Service Ribbon,[24] and the Kuwaiti Liberation Medal.[23]

>But Jennifer McVeigh thought the breaking point came earlier, in 1991, at Fort Bragg, N.C., where he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Special Forces. Army records show that Mr. McVeigh dropped out of the program after saying he could not meet the physical demands.

>In his Oct. 20 letter, Mr. McVeigh wrote that he and nine other soldiers had been taken to a private intelligence briefing at Fort Bragg, where they were told they could be required to take part in Government-sanctioned assassinations and Government-sponsored drug trafficking.

>''Why would Tim, (characteristically non-drinker), super-successful in the Army (Private to Sergeant in 2 yrs.) (Top Gun) (Bronze Star) (accepted into Special Forces), all of a sudden come home, party HARD, and, just like that, announce he was not only 'disillusioned' by SF, but was, in fact, leaving the service?'' Mr. McVeigh asked his sister.
>
>The answer, he wrote, lay in what he learned at Fort Bragg, where he and the nine others were told they might be ordered to help the Central Intelligence Agency ''fly drugs into the U.S. to fund many covert operations'' and to ''work hand-in-hand with civilian police agencies'' as ''government-paid assassins.''

>In a 1993 letter to his sister, published by The New York Times in 1998, McVeigh claimed that during his time at Fort Bragg he and nine others were recruited into a secret black ops team that smuggled drugs into the United States to fund covert activities and "were to work hand-in-hand with civilian police agencies to quiet anyone whom was deemed a security risk. (We would be gov't-paid assassins!)"[32] In a 2001 declaration[33] Terry Nichols, McVeigh's convicted co-conspirator, also alleged that McVeigh reported in December 1992 how he "had been recruited to carry out undercover missions"Paragraph 10 which initially involved visiting gun shows and making contact with a loose network of anti-government and far-right sympathizers. This undercover activity allegedly escalated to armed robberies and a planned bombing under the direction of FBI agent Larry A. Potts.Paragraph 33 David Paul Hammer, a convicted murderer in the same facility as McVeigh for about two years, reported that McVeigh stated similar allegations to him: that McVeigh was an "undercover operative" for the Department of Defense, and that Andreas Strassmeir was a similar operative but with "a different handler" and they had worked together in planning the bombing.[34]

>On April 21, McVeigh was taken from Perry to nearby Tinker Air Force Base for further questioning and arraignment and, once there, was charged as the primary and, thus far, only suspect in the bombing. He was appointed two public defenders, John Coyle and Susan Otto, to whom, unknown to the public (but documented within the Jones Collection), McVeigh made a very strange confession. He told Coyle and Otto that, while in the Army, he had been recruited to work undercover as part of a domestic security operation. McVeigh said his mission was to infiltrate and report on Neo-Nazi’s and other domestic terrorism threats. McVeigh then said that after having discovered the bombing plot, he reported it to his handlers but was instructed to continue in his role, remain embedded within the conspiracy and even go so far as to participate in the bombing; but ensure that only a couple of windows were blown out of the Murrah building. McVeigh expressed his shock that the Ryder could have caused as much damage as it did and wondered out loud if someone may have switched the truck at the last minute without his knowledge. While, within the weeks and months to come, his story would undergo radical transformation, McVeigh’s initial confession to Otto and Coyle stands as the earliest (but in no way final) Guilty Agent story that McVeigh would tell.

5. [Were There More OKC Conspirators?: The Elohim City Connection](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/PROJECTS/FTRIALS/mcveigh/moreconspirators.html)
>Elohim City ("The City of God") is a 400-acre compound located in isolated and rugged hill country on the Oklahoma-Arkansas border.  The compound was founded by white supremacist Robert Millar as a Christian Identity settlement in 1973.  The compound, which has had at times over 100 residents, has been considered to be a hotbed of anti-government and criminal activities.
>
>Phone record showing calls made by Timothy McVeigh from the Imperial Motel in Kingman, Arizona on April 5, 1995, exactly two weeks before the Oklahoma City bombing.  The first call is to the Ryder Truck Rental Company and the second, just two minutes later, is a call placed to the "Elohim City" compound in Muldrow, Oklahoma. The call was an unsuccessfull attempt to reach the man pictured below, Elohim City resident, Andreas Strassmeir.\
>[...]\
>What McVeigh's "authorized biography" says about the Elohim City connection:\
>McVeigh admitted calling Elohim City for Andreas ("Andy the German") Strassmeir on 4/5/95.  He says the purpose of the call was ask Strassmeir,who he met at a Tulsa gun show in 1994, whether he could use Elohim City as a hideout after the bombing (p244).  McVeigh admitting discussing political issues with Strassmeir, the grandson of a founder of the Nazi party, but claimed that Strassmeir had nothing to do with the bombing itself.  A polygraph test taken by McVeigh, however, showed that while he was truthful in discussing his own role in the bombing, he "showed signs of evasion" when he said no persons, other than those already charged, were involved in the bombing (p351).
>
>What federal agents said in a memo written on 4/20/1995:\
>"It is suspected that members of Elohim City are involved either directly or indirectly through conspiracy..."
>
>What McVeigh's defense attorney, Steven Jones, said:\
>"I don't doubt Tim's role in the conspiracy.  But I think he clearly aggrandized his role, enlarged it, to cover for others who were involved." (AP, 2/13/2003)
>
>What the FBI's scene commander for the Oklahoma City investigation, Danny Coulson, said in 2003:\
>"I think you have too many coincidences here that raise questions about whether other people are involved.  The close associations with Elohim City  and the earlier plan [of Elohim City residents] to do the same Murrah Building all suggest the  complicity of other people." (AP, 2/13/2003)
>
>What Dan Defenbaugh, retired FBI Chief of the Oklahoma City bombing investigation said in 2003:\
>"If I were still in the bureau, the investigation would be reopened."
>
>What two fellow inmates on death row say McVeigh revealed to them (from Secrets Worth Dying For, by David Hammer and Jeffrey Paul (2004)):\
>After receiving a tour of the Elohim City compound on 10/12/1993, McVeigh and Nichols had a meeting with Andreas Strassmeir and several other men to discuss "direct action against the federal government" (p158). Within months, McVeigh had joined two of the men he met at Elohim City in robbing banks (McVeigh served as the getaway driver)around the Midwest (p159).  In April 1994, in a meeting with Strassmeir and White Aryan Resistance leader Dennis Mahon, McVeigh first discussed blowing up the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City (p164). In September 1994, McVeigh attended a series of planning meetings in Elohim City (p167).  In early 1995,McVeigh and members of the Aryan Resistance (ARA) from Elohim City were conducting practice runs of the bombing (p173).  Michael Brescia was chosen to accompany McVeigh on his bombing run (p174).  On April 8, McVeigh met in Tulsa with Brescia and Strassmeir to discuss the bombing [and watch strippers?--see box to lower left](p175). Brescia and other ARA members assisted McVeigh in loading explosives into the Ryder truck and mixing them (p177-78). Brescia rode into Oklahoma City in the Ryder truck with McVeigh on 4/19/95, exiting at a stoplight and NW 5th Street and Harvey.  McVeigh then parked the truck in front of the Murrah Building and quickly walked in the direction of his getaway car (p182-83).
>
>What a 2003 AP report said about McVeigh's connection to Elohim City and white supremacists:\
>AP writer John Solomon's investigation led him to conclude that white supremacists from Elohim City played a major role in the bombing conspiracy. Solomon noted, for example, an FBI teletype showed that on April 16, 1995 two Elohim City gang members left the compound for a location in Kansas close to "where McVeigh was doing the final assembly of his bomb."  Solomon also reported that two Elohim City gang members, Kevin Langan and Mark Thomas, told federal agents that they could provide information linking McVeigh to Ayran Resistance.  Even more compelling evidence, Solomon reported, came from informant John Shults, who "told agents in 1997 that he was sure 'beyond a shadow of a doubt' he saw McVeigh at Elohim City in 1994 at a meeting about a mysterious delivery and use of a Ryder truck."

6. [Oklahoma City bombing conspiracy theories - Additional conspirators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing_conspiracy_theories#Additional_conspirators)
>Several witnesses reported seeing a second person with McVeigh around the time of the bombing, whom investigators later called "John Doe 2".[5] In 1997, the FBI arrested Michael Brescia, a member of Aryan Republican Army, who resembled an artist's rendering of John Doe 2 based on the eyewitness accounts. However, they later released him, reporting that their investigation had indicated he was not involved with the bombing.[6] One reporter for The Washington Post reflected on the fact that a John Doe 2 has never been found: "Maybe he'll (John Doe 2) be captured and convicted someday. If not, he'll remain eternally at large, the one who got away, the mystery man at the center of countless conspiracy theories. It's possible that he never lived. It's likely that he'll never die."[6]
>
>An informant (Carol Howe) for the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms who had infiltrated the white supremacist enclave Elohim City, Oklahoma filed a report in January 1995 stating that Andreas Strassmeir, Elohim City's security chief, had spoken about destroying a Federal building and had visited the Murrah building with another man.[7] Two days after the bombing, this informant reminded the ATF of the earlier report and urged investigation into a possible connection to Elohim City. McVeigh is known to have telephoned Elohim City two weeks before the bombing.[8] Jane Graham, a Housing and Urban Development employee at the Murrah building who survived the bombing, later stated that in the days before the bombing she had observed multiple suspicious persons who she suspected may have been involved (such as unfamiliar persons in maintenance or military uniforms), but that her observations were ignored by authorities.[9] Graham later identified one of these men as Andreas Strassmeir of Elohim City.[10]
>
>There are several theories that McVeigh and Nichols had a possible foreign connection or co-conspirators.[11][12] This was due to the fact that Terry Nichols traveled through the Philippines while terrorist mastermind Ramzi Yousef of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing was planning his Bojinka plot in Manila.[11][13] Ramzi Yousef placed the bomb used in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing inside a rented Ryder van, the same rental company used by McVeigh, indicating a possible foreign link to Al-Qaeda.[14]

7. [Aryan Republican Army - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_Republican_Army)
>The Aryan Republican Army (ARA), also dubbed "The Midwest Bank bandits" by the FBI and law-enforcement, were a white nationalist terrorist gang[1] who robbed a series of 22 banks in the Midwest from 1994 to 1996 spearheaded by frontman Peter Kevin Langan.[2] The gang who had links to Neo-Nazism and white supremacism, were alleged to have conspired with convicted terrorist Timothy McVeigh in the months before the Oklahoma City bombing terrorist attack.[3][4] Although never legally acknowledged, many theorists believe the ARA funneled robbery money to help fund the bombing as a direct response to the Waco and Ruby Ridge sieges.[5]
>
>Inspired by Mark Thomas to rob banks in order to support white supremacy movement, the ARA group, created in 1992 by Langan and his school best-friend Richard Lee Guthrie, considered themselves a leaderless organization. Although the group was mainly a criminal enterprise, they did have a terrorist like agenda. After filming and producing right wing propaganda videos, the group grew and recruited bank robber affiliates: Michael Brescia, Shawn Kenny, Kevin McCarthy, and Scott Stedeford.[1] With the bank heist money the gang began stockpiling weapons and ammunition believed to help start a race war. At bank after bank, the Mid West Bank Bandits became synonymous for leaving their signature decoy grenades and pipe bombs as calling cards, a strategy implemented to help the gang escape and delay the FBI's pursuit.[2] The bandits used a strict time keeper who called out elapsed intervals and made sure they were in and out of heists within 90 seconds. The time keeping, along with the members wearing of presidential masks, were moves believed to be lifted directly from the Katheryn Bigelow film Point Break.[2][6] In addition to wearing Nixon, Reagan and Clinton masks, the ARA also wore jackets and hats emblazoned with "FBI," "ATF" or other law-enforcement acronyms.[7]
>
>The FBI was unaware of the existence of the ARA until one of its members was apprehended. In early 1996 the group began to fall apart as members of the Aryan Republican Army were arrested after former members of the group became informants as part of a plea bargain. Guthrie was arrested in Cincinnati on January 15, 1996 concluding a 2-hour chase by bureau agents. Soon after, Guthrie gave up his counterpart Peter Langan. Three days later on January 18, 1996, the FBI arrested Langan after a shoot out near a safe house in Columbus. Langan survived the 50 round siege and was arrested.[2][8]

8. [Aryan Republican Army - Connections to the Oklahoma City bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_Republican_Army#Connections_to_the_Oklahoma_City_bombing)
>Several accounts have linked the ARA with Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 and injured hundreds more.
>
>Brescia and Guthrie both resided for a time at Elohim City, Oklahoma, a private community made up of followers of the late Christian Identity pastor Robert G. Millar, and other persons associated with right-wing extremist and white nationalist-style views. Other ARA members were known to frequent Elohim City as well. Elohim City security director Andreas Strassmeir was a known associate of Timothy McVeigh (having met him at a Tulsa gun show), and federal investigators determined that McVeigh had made a phone call to Elohim City on April 5, 1995, just two weeks prior to the Oklahoma City bombing (although no one at Elohim City claims to have spoken with him).[10]
>
>Additionally, five separate women from a nightclub in Tulsa have each identified Brescia as the man who was paying for Timothy McVeigh's drinks on April 8, 1995, just three days after McVeigh's suspicious phone call. Two more women in Kansas reported that McVeigh and Brescia were frequent associates, while Guthrie bore a distinct physical resemblance to "John Doe Number Two". Timothy McVeigh's sister, Jennifer, also claimed that he had been one of the participants in several, unspecified bank robberies.
>
>David Paul Hammer, a convicted murderer who was imprisoned with McVeigh at the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, has alleged that McVeigh told him details of the Oklahoma City bombing that contradict the account related in court. According to Hammer, McVeigh claimed to have been working as a deep cover operative for the US Department of Defense, having infiltrated ARA and participated in several of the group's bank robberies. McVeigh is further alleged to have indicated Strassmeir and several others at Elohim City were similarly government agents involved in surveillance of extremist elements of the American far-right.[11]

9. [Aryan Republican Army - Peter Kevin Langan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_Republican_Army#Peter_Kevin_Langan_(Donna_Langan))
>Langan was born in 1958 on Saipan in the South Pacific Islands. He grew up in Vietnam, where his father served in the military and CIA, before moving to the United States when Langan was 6 years old.[12] In 1974, at age 16, Langan was sentenced to up to 20 years for robbing a man of $78 and fleeing police.[2] Langan moved to Ohio in 1988, where he converted to Mormonism and became an ordained minister at what authorities describe as a Ku Klux Klan-affiliated church. During the early 1990s, Langan and his childhood friend Richard Guthrie formed the Aryan Republic Army, a white supremacist group with motives to overthrow the US government. The group turned to robbing banks in order to fund their movement.[8] On January 18, 1996, the FBI arrested Langan. Langan is now a transgender woman, Donna, and has since publicly renounced her political and racist views. After 18 years in a male prison, Donna was transferred to a female penitentiary after a legal fight in 2014 during the Obama administration. In 2017 Donna and 435 other transgender inmates from female prisons led an LGBT activist group in an effort to challenge the Trump administration's positions regarding transgender prisoners.[6][13]

>Langan, for his part, says he had nothing to do with the bombing. "Most of my family, my siblings work in federal buildings," he says. The Commander admits only to being an "eccentric," and, well, maybe a white separatist.
>
>Actually, he arrives at this point in life through a combination of dishonesty, self-delusion and pure pathology. But as criminals go, Langan is more intellectual than most: He reads Kipling and Shakespeare, can quote from "The Merchant of Venice." With his dyed, flowing hair and long, carefully tended fingernails, he impresses you as a prissy aesthete, not a hardened thug.
>
>As a psychological specimen, Langan is fascinating: a changeling of ideology and identity. He's the imaginative, multilingual boy who grew up in Saigon amid a privileged community of U.S. intelligence agents and military advisers; the pre-teen hippie who spouted leftist slogans and marched for peace and brotherhood; the runaway who had been shot and served prison time by the age of 21.
>
>Years later, he's a weapons fetishist and neo-Nazi government hater -- who's slick enough to convince the feds that he's on their side. In 1993, the U.S. Secret Service sprang Langan from jail, allowing Commander Pedro and his ragtag revolutionary army to launch their bank-robbery spree.\
[...]\
>They lived cheaply, but the four-man army didn't skimp on business needs. Testimony and evidence shows that Langan established a separate cash trove dedicated to what he called "the Company" to cover expenses: getaway vehicles, police scanners, bulletproof vests, pagers, phone cards, walkie-talkies, phony IDs, hotel rooms, safe houses, storage lockers and, of course, weapons.
>
>The Company name resonates on two levels. It's the code word Bob Mathews used for the Order, and Langan believes his father, Eugene, was a CIA agent: "Yes, the Commander grew up in the Company," he says in the video. (Other Langan family members say this is true, though the CIA won't discuss anyone's employment.)
>
>Pete Langan ran the Company with his longtime friend Richard Guthrie -- a holdup man and fraud artist who liked to be called "Wild Bill." Langan and Guthrie grew up within blocks of each other in Wheaton, although they didn't become close until years later. "They were more than friends -- they were brothers," says Norman Smith, a felon who knew them both.
>
>Some say Wild Bill was even more unstable and politically extreme than Langan -- a bad influence, if that's possible. Guthrie was kicked out of the Navy in 1983 -- for painting a swastika on the side of a ship and threatening superiors, Smith says.\
>[...]\
>Summer 1963: As the Diem government of South Vietnam totters, the capital is inflamed by civil and religious strife: riots, bombings, a wave of self-immolations by Buddhist monks, martial law. Eugene F. Langan and his wife, Mary Ann, are at the center of the crisis. So are their six children.
>
>A retired Marine Corps major, Langan is a public safety official attached to the International Cooperation Administration (the forerunner of the Agency for International Development). He provides intelligence and helps to train local police. Mary Ann is a receptionist in the U.S. Embassy annex; she narrowly escapes injury when the building is bombed.
>
>For the Langan kids -- three boys, three girls -- these are times of excitement and terror: watching riots from the rooftop patio of their stucco villa, fleeing tear-gas shells lobbed on the lawn.
>
>Stationed in Saigon since 1960, the family has known good times, too. It has the requisite maids, gardeners and cooks. Pete, the youngest, is enrolled as "enfant de membre" in a Saigon sports club (and decades later still carried the card to prove it). He has a driver who picks him up at the French Catholic kindergarten and always made sure to stop for a treat of freshly squeezed sugarcane juice on the way home.
>
>Like most boys, Pete aspires to be like his dad -- a career soldier of the Great Santini school who imposed military discipline on his family to the extent that each member had a rank. Gruff, but capable of warmth, and somewhat mysterious -- that was Eugene Langan.
>
>"Before anyone told me, I had in my mind that he went on secret missions," Pete recalls. "I don't know whether it was a typical childhood fantasy, but I felt it was true."
>
>By 1964, the father relocates his family to the safety of Wheaton, a Cleaveresque neighborhood of mostly government workers. Eugene Langan goes back to Vietnam; Pete pines for his father to come home. Finally, in 1967, Dad returns -- suffering from stress, asthma and emphysema exacerbated by too much time in a tropical climate.
>
>In the woods along the creek, Pete plays soldier, enlisting other boys. "We used to involve the whole neighborhood in large-scale army battles," he recalls with a wistful smile. This is how he bonds with his father: "I used to go and hunt down the Viet Cong, then come in the living room and give him the body counts."
>
>Within a few months, everything changes. Maj. Langan, much-decorated veteran of World War II and Korea, dies of a heart attack at age 50. Pete gets to keep his father's Marine Corps ring.\
[...]\
>At 12 he is caught joyriding in a stolen car. He's sent to military school but goes AWOL. He sews peace signs on an old Army jacket. He steals a copy of Abbie Hoffman's yippie tract, "Steal This Book."\
>[...]\
>After five years in prison, Pete emerged as a racial separatist. He tried the straight life -- college, marriage, honest labor -- and failed at them all. His siblings pursued military careers and jobs with federal agencies. He struggled as a handyman while raising a son after his divorce.\
>[...]\
>Langan moved to Ohio, where he converted to Mormonism in 1988 but later became an ordained minister in what authorities describe as a Ku Klux Klan-affiliated church. He lived with his sister, Leslie, an IRS employee in Cincinnati. He then moved in with a girlfriend, Faith Ford, who also worked for the IRS and described herself as a "white Christian."
>
>At Ford's house, Langan stockpiled guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. He dressed his young son in military camouflage.
>
>In October 1992, Guthrie and Langan hooked up to rob a small-town Pizza Hut in Georgia. That puny-paying job (about $900 each) whetted their appetite for bigger jackpots and grander accomplishments. Double Cross\
>[...]\
>By August 1993, Georgia authorities had Langan cold on the Pizza Hut holdup. He faced a potential life sentence. Ohio also wanted him on weapons violations. Then the Secret Service intervened.
>
>The deal was unbelievably sweet. The local prosecutor would let Langan out of jail free, recommending that his bail be lowered from $150,000 to $8,000, allowing him a signature bond. The local cops deferred to the Secret Service, which put Langan on a bus back to Ohio and gave him $50 traveling money.
>
>All he had to do was look for Richard Guthrie.
>
>The Secret Service wanted Guthrie for supposedly making threats against President Bush during a campaign swing through Georgia about the same time as the Pizza Hut job.
>
>"I don't envy y'all the task of finding him," Langan told a Carnesville, Ga., sheriff's investigator in a taped interview. "He's got friends, associates, contacts all over the country. . . . He can obtain identification and registrations 10,000 different ways."
>
>By Sept. 2, Langan was riding, without handcuffs, in the passenger seat of a Secret Service agent's car, bound for the bus terminal in Atlanta. After he arrived in Cincinnati, the feds paid to install a phone in his home so he could try to "contact" Guthrie.
>
>The local agent assigned to the case checked in with Langan several times, but after Nov. 12, never heard from him again. Langan's cooperation had lasted all of six weeks.

>"Richard Lee Guthrie, Jr., the son of the CIA employee, discharge from the Navy for painting a swastika on the side of a ship and threatening superiors, his childhood friend Peter K. Langan, and Shawn Kenny, went on to form the nucleus of a group known as the Midwest Bank Bandits. The group stole more than $250,000 from 22 banks between January, '94 and December, '95 in a spree that led them across Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri. The four member group would often wear FBI jackets to taunt the Bureau, and create diversions to foil police, including leaving behind inert pipe-bombs to slow pursuit. The bandits even had a macabre sense of humor, wearing a Santa Claus suit during a hold up around Christmas, and an Easter basket with a gold painted pipe bomb left inside a bank in Des Moines.

>Through them, he learned of Arkansas gun dealer Roger Moore and his girlfriend Karen Anderson, who ran a mail-order gun and ammunition business and had many associates in the movement. Unknown to his customers and friends, Moore, who himself used a number of aliases, was a highly protected federal asset/informant whose connections with shadowy covert government operators, mercenaries and international arms dealers, could be traced at least as far back as the Iran-Contra era. When Colbern contacted Moore (whom he knew as ‘Bob Anderson’), Moore suggested he contact a man named Tim Tuttle, who Moore described as the “leader of hard core guys in Kingman” and “a former member of the Special Forces” who had been “over trained.” Tuttle, said Moore, was “very restless,’ “traveled frequently” and regularly camped in the Hualapai Mountains. Moore gave Colbern a P.O. Box address in Kingman where he could write to Tuttle. [NOTE: "TIM TUTTLE" WAS AN ALIAS USED MY TIMOTHY MCVEIGH]

>Early on his travels, in January 1993, while at a gun show in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, [McVeigh] met Roger Moore, a gun dealer who divided his time between Arkansas and southern Florida. McVeigh was selling “White Power’ t-shirts and copies of The Turner Diaries, and the two struck up a conversation. No stranger to the extreme right, Moore claimed to have been involved with training anti-Castro Cubans. By the 1970's and 1980's, he was a self-made millionaire mainly, he said, by building speedboats for government agencies including the CIA and other elite clientele. Moore ran with the ‘Iran/Contra’ crowd (think Ollie North), had numerous international arms dealing associates and was in tight with Civilian Military Assistance, a group of CIA-backed mercenaries who, during the late 1980's were involved in the U.S’s clandestine activities in Nicaragua and later, at the exact time McVeigh met Moore, were a key group in the FBI's PATCON operation (although whether as targets, assets or both is un- clear). Like McVeigh, Moore employed numerous aliases but most people knew him as Bob Miller or Bob Anderson. Moore was a familiar face on the gun show circuit where he promoted his homemade porn distribution enterprise and mail order firearms business.
>
>In the preceding years, Moore himself had been the subject of state and federal investigations on more than one occasion. From 1989 until March 1993, the Arkansas and Oregon State Police, as well as the ATF, FBI and Department of Defense, would investigate Moore for various in- fractions including plans to mail hundreds of pounds of C4 explosives through the mail; sale of government property stolen from military instal- lations (including ammunition); intent to sell explosives and bootlegged porn (origins of which are unknown); and the sale of ammunition, gre- nades, and flares, that he, again, shipped through the mail. Each time an investigation into Moore’s activities was begun, it was just as quickly ended, mainly through the request or inaction of the FBI.’ After the bombing, Moore claimed he was a government informant, although by the looks of it, he was much more than that. According to Terry Nichols, Moore, one of the first contacts in McVeigh’s “network of friends,” helped instruct McVeigh on the ins and outs of the gun show circuit, where he would spin the web of contacts needed to carry out the bombing. Either way, Moore and McVeigh became fast friends. They met up again a couple weeks later, and Moore invited McVeigh to stop by his Arkansas ranch some time.

>In the run-up to the trials, the government largely accepted Roger Moore’s account and groomed him as a prosecution witness. But the government’s own infor- mation, along with previously unpublished research by defense investigators and a firsthand account from Terry Nichols, all suggest that Moore could as easily have been a participant in the plot, not only facilitating the supposed robbery but also offering valuable instruction on bomb-building.
>
>Moore and Anderson said the April 1994 visit was McVeigh’s last, but McVeigh’s defense team later obtained information suggesting that he returned once or twice more that summer to pick up batches of Kinestik, a binary explosive kit whose components were ammonium nitrate and nitromethane—the very ingredients later used to blow up the Murrah Building. Moore, according to this information (later deemed genuine by McVeigh in his interviews with Michel and Herbeck), had cases of the stuff and did not sell it “to just anybody.” Terry Nichols said Kinestik packs supplied by Moore were used as boosters for the ammonium nitrate barrels he and McVeigh mixed at Geary Lake. According to Nichols, Moore also gave McVeigh blasting caps and cannon fuse.
>
>Nichols is not a neutral source, of course. Since 2005, when he first started talking about his own role in the bomb plot, he has pushed to have Moore arrested and prosecuted as a coconspirator. He told the FBI they could find Moore’s fingerprints on a box of nitromethane tubes, originally components from Kinestik kits, which were hidden beneath his house in Herington. When Nichols’s accusations first surfaced, Moore not only denied any wrongdoing; he accused Nichols of acquiring the Kinestik himself because he was an “angry man” with his own agenda. The FBI found fingerprint traces on the box Nichols was talking about, but they did not test them for almost three years and then concluded that the prints were unreadable.
>
>Investigators working for the Nichols defense team spent two years unearthing everything they could about Roger Moore. And the more they dug, the more bewilderingly complex the man became. He had spent years working for the federal government he later professed to hate, first for the Social Security Administration in Iowa, and then for the air force. In the 1960s, he and his wife, Carol, had jobs and top-secret security clearances at North American Aviation. From there, they moved to Florida, where they made a fortune in the boat-building business, cashing out in 1977 to settle into a long retirement.
>
>The impression Moore gave to his neighbors and acquaintances in Arkansas was of an angry, suspicious, conspiracy-spewing, tight-fisted gun nut who did not know how to make friends or observe basic rules of civility. He would fire high-powered rifle- rounds and mortars on his ranch after dark, which even in rural Arkansas was regarded as eccentric. Once, he let off a smoke bomb and knocked one of his neighbors unconscious for twenty minutes. He never apologized.\
>[...]\
>Still, rumors about Moore abounded. Some of the more fantastical—and unverified—stories that circu- lated after the bombing suggested he might have taught sabotage techniques for the CIA at the Camp Peary military base in Virginia, or had been a participant in the Reagan administration’s illicit efforts to sell arms to the Nicaraguan contras, or had manufactured pontoon boats used by the CIA to mine three Nicaraguan ports in 1984, or had funneled information to the government on Barry Seal, a former CIA pilot who organized drug transports to Central America from Mena, Arkansas, not far from Moore’s ranch.
>
>The Nichols team did not know what to make of such stories, but they found more reasons of their own to question Moore’s connections and activities. Despite his background as a successful businessman, and the existence of at least two bank accounts in his name, they found he had almost no credit history. They never figured out why. They also puzzled over a line Moore had given to Rodney Bowers of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette shortly after his first FBI interviews became public.
>
>“Whatever I was doing for the FBI,” Moore said, “is fucked up, because they blew my cover.” Bowers later told defense investigators that Moore had called him in a fury when he saw this quoted in the paper. But he would not elaborate on what he meant.

16. [Andreas Strassmeir - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Strassmeir)
>Andreas Carl Strassmeir[5][6] (born May 17, 1959) is a German national[7] and the former head-of-security for the white separatist community, Elohim City, Oklahoma. He gained media attention for his alleged connection to the Oklahoma City Bombing and has become an important figure in its conspiracy theories.[8][9][10][11]

17. [The Road to Elohim Part II](http://visupview.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-road-to-elohim-part-ii.html)
>Present at the Berlin Wall on the night of 11/9/89 was a man named Gunter Strassmeir, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union in West Berlin. [Gunter] Strassmeir, whose father was an early member of the Nazi party, became the de facto chief of staff for Chancellor Helmut Kohl and played a key role in the reunification of Germany in the early 90s. At the same time as Gunter was involved in this endeavor his son, Andreas, was beginning his stint as Elohim City's chief of security.
>
>Seemingly this was a rather strange career move for a man who was the son of a former Parliamentary Secretary of State, whose uncle was in the German Parliament and brother sat on the Berlin City Council, and who have been in the midst only promising military career before departing for the United States.
>
>>"Andreas served as a lieutenant in the German Panzer Grenadiers (the equivalent of our Special Forces), had formal military intelligence training, and did a stint as a liaisons officer for the Welsh Guards.  He told the London Sunday Telegraph that part of his work was to detect infiltration by Warsaw Pact agents, and then feed them disinformation. 'If we caught a guy, we'd offer him amnesty. We'd turn him and use him to feed false information back to the Warsaw Pact.' While Strassmeir would not admit it, it is reported that he is an agent for the German national anti-terrorist police, the GSG-9."
(The Oklahoma City Bombing and the Politics of Terror, David Hoffman, pg. 122)
>
>Accounts of when exactly Strassmeir entered the United States and under whose auspices vary. In some versions Andreas arrived here in 1989 as part of a group of Germans looking to participate in a reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg. It was amidst the Civil War reenactment crowd that Strassmeir began rubbing shoulders with members of the US intelligence community, most notably retired U.S. Air Force Col. Vincent Petruskie. This website notes:
>>"Once Strassmeir arrived on our shores... he quickly gravitated toward, of all things, the Civil War reenactment crowd. Why does this seemingly innocuous bit of trivia merit mention? Because historically, this group has been infiltrated by a variety of CIA splinter groups that use it as a front for illegal gun-smuggling. More importantly, though, The London Times reported that when Strassmeir first arrived in the United States, he was befriended by retired Army officers, CIA veterans, and Civil War reenactment history buffs. These men were part of a network that is very powerful in this country, and one that stretches into the Pentagon and other federal agencies.
>>
>>"One of these men was Vincent Petruskie, who was a special agent for the Air Force Office of Special Investigation (OSI) from 1954-1975, and who also knew Strassmeir’s father in Berlin. Petruskie was also a foreign intelligence officer in Vietnam, a member of the 1131st U.S. Air Force Special Activities Squadron, a Special Projects Officer in the Special Activities Branch of the counter-intelligence division in Washington, D.C., and was also reactivated during the Gulf War to fulfill a ‘sensitive assignment.’
>>
>>"Needless to say, Petruskie was connected to deep intelligence sources for decades, and interacted with a cabal of ex-military men and former & current CIA employees who were involved in gun running, mercenary actions, espionage, drug trafficking, blackmail & subversion, and money laundering. These were off-record, black budget operatives, and Vincent Petruskie made a career out of soliciting and deal-making with these shadowy figures.
>>
>>"So, when Andreas Strassmeir arrived in America and needed a place to stay, who opened his doors to him? None other than Vincent Petruskie of Petruskie Associates in Manassas, Virginia; a man who was making at the time $1.6 million/year by working out of his house. How did Strassmeir know Petruskie? In his own words, Strassmeir described his ally as, 'a former CIA guy my father had known.' But Petruskie’s friendship didn’t end at mere lodging. In addition, he tried to get Strassmeir a job at the DEA, the Treasury Department, with INS, and also the Department of Justice."

18. [Andreas Strassmeir - Time in the U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Strassmeir#Time_in_the_U.S.)
>After resigning from the British Welsh Guard, Strassmeir moved to Washington, D.C. to pursue a career within the U.S. Department of Justice. According to Strassmeir himself, he had hoped to work for the operations section of the Drug Enforcement Administration.[15] His efforts to obtain a career within the federal government were aided by Vincent Petruskie, a retired U.S. Air Force colonel who had apparently met Strassmeir's father while he (Petruskie) was stationed in Berlin. In interviews, Strassmeir has referred to Vincent Petruskie as "a former CIA guy my father had known".[16] Petruskie confirms that he had assisted Andreas Strassmeir in finding such a job, but denies having any connection to the CIA.
>
>Strassmeir moved to Houston, Texas, in 1986 where he started working as a salesman for a computer company.[17] During this time, he became involved with the Texas Light Infantry militia before eventually getting expelled due to speculation from members that Strassmeir was a government agent.[18][19] Afterwards, he became active in right wing and neo-Nazi circles where he eventually met his future attorney, Kirk Lyons.[citation needed]
>
>Andreas Strassmeir was also reported to have spent some time in Knoxville, Tennessee, where he obtained a state drivers license. According to Ray Woodruff, a landlord of Strassmeir's, he rented a 1,300-square-foot house located at 7613 Thorngrove Pike but never lived in it.[20][21]

19. [Andreas Strassmeir - Elohim City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Strassmeir#Elohim_City)
>In 1991, Kirk Lyons introduced Andreas Strassmeir to Elohim City - a white separatist community in Oklahoma. A year later, Strassmeir moved there and became the chief of security and weapons training.[22] According to Lyons, Strassmeir hoped to marry an Elohim City woman and gain permanent resident status in the United States.
>
>During this time, he struck a friendship with Michael William Brescia, a member of the Aryan Republican Army. The two shared a room together on the compound.[23]
>
>While working as a confidential informant (CI) for the ATF, Elohim City resident, Carol Howe informed her agency handler about Andreas Strassmeir and how he would frequently talk about "blowing up federal buildings" and using "direct action against the U.S. Government".[24] At the time, Carol Howe was unaware of Strassmeir's full name, and simply knew him as "Andy the German".
>
>After the OKC Bombing, Strassmeir fled the compound with fellow Elohim City residents Pete and Tony Ward.[25]

20. [Andreas Strassmeir - McVeigh's Phone Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Strassmeir#McVeigh's_Phone_Call)
>On April 5, 1995 - exactly two weeks before the bombing - Timothy McVeigh telephoned Elohim City just minutes after he had reserved the Ryder rental van that was used to blow up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. This telephone call was answered by community resident Joan Millar, the daughter-in-law of Robert G. Millar.[26][27]

21. [Andreas Strassmeir - Relationship With McVeigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Strassmeir#Relationship_With_McVeigh)
>Information from various sources, regarding the relationship between the two, tend to conflict with one another - making it difficult to determine such an aspect. However, it is known that Andreas Strassmeir and Timothy McVeigh first met at a gun show in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1993.[28][29]
>
>According to Strassmeir himself, he says that he provided Timothy McVeigh with a business card which had Elohim City's phone number on it when they had met.[30]
>
>On April 8, 1995 (eleven days prior to the Oklahoma City bombing), Andreas Strassmeir was allegedly spotted in the company of McVeigh and Brescia at a topless strip club in Tulsa known as Lady Godiva's. Strassmeir was identified by witnesses at the club, including a stripper who worked there.[31][32]
>
>A week before the bombing occurred, Strassmeir, along with Brescia and McVeigh were all reportedly seen together in Herington, Kansas. Two additional witnesses by the names of Larry and Cathy Wild, claimed they saw and talked with Strassmeir at a lake north of the city. There have been allegations that this is the location where McVeigh and his accomplice, Terry Nichols had purchased and stockpiled the ingredients of an ANFO bomb - the type of bomb used in the Oklahoma City bombing. Additionally, it has been alleged that Herington was also the place where the Ryder truck used in the attack (by McVeigh) was rented.[33]

22. [Andreas Strassmeir - Departure from the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Strassmeir#Departure_from_the_United_States)
>Robert Millar quickly "expelled" Andreas Strassmeier from Elohim City soon after he became aware that the FBI was looking at Strassmeir for possible ties to McVeigh and the bombing.[34]
>
>Notes from a 1997 FBI investigation state that sometime after the bombing, CIA pilot Dave Halloway flew Andreas Strassmer out of the United States.[35] While that same report records that Strassmeir was flown to Berlin, many have speculated that he was instead flown to Mexico.[36] However, in a letter to the McCurtain Gazette from Strassmeir's attorney Kirk Lyons, he says his client's sudden departure from the U.S. was aided by members of Germany's elite counterterrorism unit, GSG 9.[37]

>HOLLAWAY is employed as an applications engineer for the THRUSTMASTER (a marine propulsion Concern) in Houston, Texas. He purported to have had a variety of life experiences include eight years in the United States Army (Special Forces) with EOD training; working two years on the research vessel "KNOOR" operated by the University of North Carolina; one year of mechanical engineering studies at the University of North Carolina: six years of work in purcuit of a PhD; one year of employment with the Corpus Christi Texas Police Department (with assignment as a diver); two years with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as a pilot; and the ownership of a company selling computer equipment- HOLLANAY also claimed a three year affiliation with a Foundation known as "CADSEN and having been an intermediary for negotiations, between government representatives and far right individuals and groups at various times.\
>[...]\
>At one point during their discussions, HOLLAWAY admitted to have spoken to TIMOTHY MCVEIGH on the telephone two days before the detonation of a truck bomb outside the Oklahoma City Federal Building. In reference to that particular event, HOLLAWAY stated "the fucking truck was too far away" and indicated that it was not parked in the position which would inflict the most damage on the building. While describing the Oklahoma City bombing, HOLLAWAY was able to provide technical details concerning the truck bomb and ANFO (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil) to include its blast over-pressure, fragmentation distances and deflagration with an alarming degree of specificity. Additionally, changes in HOLLAWAY'S body language while describing the Oklahoma City bombing, to include the rolling of his eyes when describing the truck not being parked in a place to wreck maximum destruction, provided the indication HOLLAWAY was attempting to communicate and involvement on his part in that bombing without verbally acknowledging participation.

24. [Terry Nichols - Adulthood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Nichols#Adulthood)
>Nichols had never liked farm life, and in 1988, at the age of 33, he tried to escape it by enlisting in the United States Army.[22] He was sent to Fort Benning next to Columbus, Georgia for basic training. As the oldest man in his platoon, he had difficulty with the physical aspect of the training,[23] and was sometimes called "grandpa" by the other men. However, he was soon made the platoon guide because of his age.[5] Timothy McVeigh was in his platoon, and they quickly became close friends. They had a common background: both men grew up in white rural areas and disliked working with black people. Both had tried college for a while and had parents who were divorced.[24] They shared political views[2] and interests in gun collecting and the survivalist movement.[5] The two were later stationed together at Fort Riley in Junction City, Kansas,[5] where they met and became friends with their future accomplice, Michael Fortier.[25]
>
>Nichols's wife filed for divorce soon after he joined the Army. Due to a conflict over childcare,[6] he requested and was given a hardship discharge in May 1989 to return home to take care of his son, who was seven years old at the time.[5] As he departed, he told a fellow soldier that he would be starting his own military organization soon, and would have an unlimited supply of weapons.[25]

25. [The Oklahoma Bombing Conspirators](http://law2.umkc.edu/Faculty/Projects/FTrials/mcveigh/conspirators.html)
>Michael Joseph Fortier was born in Maine in 1968, then moved with his family to Kingman, Arizona at age seven.  After graduating from Kingman High, Fortier entered the army, where he met Timothy McVeigh at Fort Benning, Georgia in 1988.  The company, which also included Terry Nichols, moved on to Fort Riley, Kansas, where Fortier served until his honorable discharge in May 1991.

>Within days of a militant attack earlier this year on the Indian consulate in the western Afghan city of Herat, intelligence officials in Kabul and Delhi were told by their US counterparts that communication intercepts indicated that the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba group (LeT) was responsible.
>
>A lucky shot from a guard had hit the leader of the assault team, giving defenders time to prepare and the four attackers had all been killed. US officials said they had aimed to take hostages and cause a drawn-out crisis intended to destabilise India’s new prime minister, Narendra Modi, just days after his landslide election win.
>
>The new details of the operation will be seen as further evidence of the close relationship between LeT and Pakistan’s security establishment.
>
>LeT was responsible for a 2008 attack on the Indian commercial capital of Mumbai in which around 170 people were killed by militants who had arrived by boat from the southern Pakistani port city of Karachi. A key figure in the attack told US and court officials that middle-ranking officials from the Pakistani military’s Directorate of InterServices Intelligence (ISI) had at very least facilitated the assault.
>
>Western intelligence officials also believe the ISI has close relations with the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network, an insurgent faction which has repeatedly struck international targets in Afghanistan.
>
>“There have been intelligence reports that link the ISI particularly to the Haqqani network,” Joseph Dunford, the commander of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, said in April.
>
>The ISI also maintains links with a range of sectarian groups within Pakistan and outfits primarily focussed on fighting Indian security forces in Kashmir.
>
>Some blame these continuing relationships for the carnage at the army-run school in Peshawar on Tuesday.
>
>The link is indirect. Few say that there is any connection between the Pakistan Taliban (TTP), the rough coalition of groups that has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the country’s security establishment.
>
>“The military formally and institutionally considers the TTP as an enemy of the state as it has killed many soldiers over the years,” said Michael Kugelman of the Woodrow Wilson centre in Washington.
>
>Pakistan’s use of certain militant groups as strategic assets, however, makes concerted action against others impossible, according to Ajai Sahni, an Indian security analyst.
>
>“If you allow space for armed Islamist groups you can’t really distinguish one from another,” Sahni said.
>
>The policy of using militants as auxiliaries goes back to the earliest days of the new Pakistani nation and its partition from India following independence from Britain. Such forces were seen by the new country’s military commanders as an effective way of countering their eastern neighbour’s huge demographic, economic and military advantage. They have played a key role in Pakistan’s four wars with India. Auxiliaries were also deployed in Kashmir in the 1990s. When hundreds of Pakistani militants infiltrated across the de facto frontier in the disputed Himalayan territory in 1999, they sparked the most recent overt conflict.
>
>Indian police documents seen by the Guardian reveal LeT’s logistical assistance to militant networks engaged in acts of terrorism in recent years in the emerging economic power.
>
>In Afghanistan, the ISI has long tried to use often fractious Afghan insurgents to extend Pakistani influence and restrict India’s in the country. In the winter of 2001, as thousands of fighters fled into Pakistan, the country’s policymakers drew a clear distinction between Afghan Taliban, seen as assets and allies, volunteer fighters often from hardline Pakistani sectarian groups who were sent home, and al-Qaida operatives who were held and given to the US in return for bounty. Over the next decade, Afghan insurgent groups, bolstered by fighters from LeT and other Pakistan-based outfits, were then “managed” as they fought international troops.
>
>Angry US officials warned Pakistan of the potential consequences of its policies.
>
>“You can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours. Eventually those snakes are going to turn on whoever has them in the backyard,” Hilary Clinton, then the US secretary of state, told reporters on a 2011 visit to Pakistan.
>
>The Pakistani army, increasingly a target of homegrown militants, has been fighting the Pakistan Taliban since 2008 in a series of bitter campaigns along the frontier with Afghanistan. Casualties have been heavy and officers cite the many killed to rebut accusations that they are soft on terrorists. Many commanders believe that India backs their enemies. Recent statements by senior Pakistani soldiers and a long-awaited offensive launched in June into the key militant redoubt of North Waziristan, where the Haqqani network is based, has led some to argue that a major change in policy was already underway before this week’s attack on the school.
>
>Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan’s prime minister, has said that henceforward there would be “no differentiation between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ Taliban” and that “the war against terrorism [will go on] ‘til the last terrorist is eliminated.” Despite the tacit admission of previous errors, many onlookers remain unconvinced.
>
>“The strategy will continue until there’s a peace deal with India, and that won’t be soon,” said Kugelman.
>
>For Sahni, Pakistan’s policy of using militants as proxies is “entrenched”.
>
>“They will go after the TTP hammer and tongs, and leave the rest untouched,” he said.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Nedelya_Church_assault
>The St Nedelya Church assault was a terrorist attack on St Nedelya Church in Sofia, Bulgaria. It was carried out on 16 April 1925, when a group of the Military Organisation of the Bulgarian Communist Party directed and supplied by the Soviet Military Intelligence blew up the church's roof during the funeral service of General Konstantin Georgiev, who had been killed in a previous communist assault on 14 April. 150 people, mainly from the country's political and military elite, were killed in the attack and around 500 bystander believers, who attended the liturgy, were injured.[1]

2. [St Nedelya Church assault - Direct consequences]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Nedelya_Church_assault#Direct_consequences
>The evening after the terrorist attack, martial law was declared. The attack caused a wave of violent repressions organized by the Military Union with the government's tacit approval. During the following two weeks, approximately 450 people were executed without trial, including poet Geo Milev and journalist Yosif Herbst. (A mass grave of those killed in 1925 was discovered in the 1950s during the construction of a dam, and Milev's corpse was identified by his glass eye - he had lost an eye in World War I.) Many other communists were heavily judged for taking part in the organization. The MO leaders Kosta Yankov and Ivan Minkov were among those assassinated. A few of the organizers of the attack, such as Zlatarev, Petar Abadzhiev and Nikola Petrov, managed to escape to the Soviet Union through Yugoslavia. Abandoned by his party, Zadgorski surrendered to the police and made a confession.
>
>The assault trial took place before a military court in Sofia between 1–11 May 1925. Zadgorski, Lieutenant-Colonel Georgi Koev, who unsuccessfully attempted to hide Minkov, and Marko Fridman, an MO section leader, were all sentenced to death. Stanke Dimitrov, Petar Abadzhiev, Dimitar Grancharov, Nikolay Petrini and Hristo Kosovski received capital punishment by default, with the last three of those having already been killed in the previous weeks. Marko Fridman, the highest-ranked individual of those accused, confessed that the organization was financed and supplied with weaponry from the Soviet Union, but pinned the ultimate responsibility for the attack on Yankov and Minkov, who, according to Fridman, acted without the BCP management's agreement.

He returned to Belgium by the end of the same year.[23] In 2014, independent journalists Étienne Huver and Guillaume Lhotellier visited the Syria–Turkey border, where they obtained photos and video of Abaaoud's time in Syria. One portion of this material showed Abaaoud and others loading bloody corpses into a truck and trailer before Abaaoud grinned and told the camera: "Before we towed jet skis, motorcycles, quad bikes, big trailers filled with gifts for vacation in Morocco. Now, thank God, following God's path, we're towing apostates, infidels who are fighting us."[24] Within Syria, Abaaoud is known to have been active at Hraytan. A diary entry while there records: "Admittedly there is no joy in spilling blood, although it's nice to see, from time to time, the blood of the infidels".[25]

>According to data from Interpol and Serbian officials, at least one of the guns used in the November 13 terror attacks in Paris was purchased by Century International Arms and then re-exported to Europe. One of the largest arms dealers in the United States, Century Arms has close ties to the CIA and has faced accusations in America and Europe of involvement in illegal arms deals.
>
>The weapon, an M92 semiautomatic pistol, was produced at the Zastava arms factory in Kragujevac, Serbia. Last week, factory manager Milojko Brzakovic told AP he had checked its records on seven weapons that it manufactured that were used in the Paris attacks. It delivered several of the weapons inside Yugoslavia before that country dissolved amid capitalist restoration and civil war in the 1990s, but it delivered the pistol in May 2013 to Century Arms, based in Delray Beach, Florida. This account was corroborated by Serbian Interior Ministry officials.
>
>AP subsequently retracted its account under pressure from the US government. The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said that Century Arms sold the pistol inside the United States, and that it was subsequently used to commit a crime in Mexico and seized by Mexican authorities.
>
>Century Arms required US government approval to legally import the firearm into the United States, however, and whoever re-exported the pistol would have had to submit a request to the US State Department in order to do so legally.
>
>These reports further undermine the official presentation of the Paris attacks by governments, media, and pro-imperialist “left” parties. They insisted that the attacks were an act of Islamist terror in which the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) alone was involved and bore full responsibility.
>
>This presentation was always a political fraud, insofar as the NATO powers were undoubtedly politically implicated. The attacks were led by Islamist fighters trained in Syria—where the CIA, European intelligence and Persian Gulf oil sheikdoms have given financial and military backing to such Islamist forces to topple President Bashar al-Assad. Though placed on watch lists and monitored by intelligence services, these fighters were somehow allowed to prepare highly complex, coordinated attacks in Paris.
>
>Reports of a concrete link between Century Arms and the Paris attacks, however, raise specifically whether elements in the intelligence services aided the attackers—either inadvertently, due to their reckless war policy, or deliberately, to shift the political atmosphere far to the right.

>David Koresh (/kəˈrɛʃ/; born Vernon Wayne Howell; August 17, 1959 – April 19, 1993) was an American cult leader[2][3][4] who played a central role in the Waco siege of 1993.[5][6] As the head of the Branch Davidians,[7] a religious sect and offshoot of the Davidian Seventh-day Adventists, Koresh claimed to be its final prophet. His apocalyptic Biblical teachings, including interpretations of the Book of Revelation and the Seven Seals, attracted various followers.[8]
>
>Coming from a dysfunctional background, Koresh was a member and later a leader of the Branch Davidians, a movement originally led by Benjamin Roden, based at the Mount Carmel Center outside Waco, Texas. Here, Koresh competed for dominance with another leader, Benjamin Roden's son George, until Koresh and his followers took over Mount Carmel in 1987. In the early 1990s, he became subject to allegations about polygamy and child sexual abuse by former Branch Davidian associates, although investigation by authorities found no conclusive evidence.
>
>Further allegations related to the Branch Davidians' stockpiling of weapons led the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) and later the FBI to launch a raid on the group's Mount Carmel compound in February 1993. During the 51-day siege and violence that ensued, Koresh was wounded by ATF forces and later died of a gunshot in unclear circumstances as the compound was destroyed in a fire.

Before Koresh was born, his father met another teenaged girl and abandoned Bonnie Sue, who began cohabitating with a violent alcoholic.[10] In 1963, Koresh's mother left with her boyfriend and placed her four-year-old son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Earline Clark. His mother returned when he was seven, after her marriage to a carpenter named Roy Haldeman. Bonnie Sue and Haldeman had a son together, named Roger, who was born in 1966.

>At the time of the attacks, Breivik was a member of the Lodge of St. Olaf at the Three Columns in Oslo[313] and had displayed photographs of himself in partial Masonic regalia on his Facebook profile.[314][315] In interviews after the attacks, his lodge said it had only minimal contact with him, and that when made aware of Breivik's membership, Grand Master of the Norwegian Order of Freemasons, Ivar A. Skaar, issued an edict immediately excluding him from the fraternity based upon the acts he carried out and the values that appear to have motivated them.[316][317] According to the Lodge records, Breivik took part in a total of four meetings between his initiation in February 2007 and his exclusion from the order (one each to receive the first, second, and third degrees, and one other meeting)[318] and held no offices or functions within the Lodge.[319] Skaar said that although Breivik was a member of the Order, his actions showed that he was in no way a Mason.[318]

4. [Anders Behring Breivik - Knights Templar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Behring_Breivik#Knights_Templar)
>In his manifesto and during interrogation, Breivik claimed membership in an "international Christian military order", which he called the new Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Solomonici (PCCTS, Knights Templar). According to Breivik, the order was established as an "anti-Jihad crusader-organisation" that "fights" against "Islamic suppression" in London in April 2002 by nine men: two Englishmen, a Frenchman, a German, a Dutchman, a Greek, a Russian, a Norwegian (apparently Breivik), and a Serb (supposedly the initiator, not present, but represented by Breivik). The compendium gives a "2008 estimate" that there are between 15 and 80 "Justiciar Knights" in Western Europe, and an unknown number of civilian members, and Breivik expects the order to take political and military control of Western Europe.[333]
>
>Breivik gave his own code name in the organisation as Sigurd and that of his assigned "mentor" as Richard, after the twelfth-century crusaders and kings Sigurd Jorsalfar of Norway and Richard the Lionheart of England.[334] He called himself a one-man cell of this organisation, and claimed that the group has several other cells in Western countries, including two more in Norway.[95] On 2 August 2011, Breivik offered to provide information about these cells, but on unrealistic preconditions.[335]
>
>After an intense investigation assisted internationally by several security agencies, the Norwegian police did not find any evidence a PCCTS network existed, or that an alleged 2002 London meeting ever took place. The police concluded Breivik's claim was a figment of his imagination because of his schizophrenia diagnosis, and were confident that he had no accessories. Breivik continued to insist he belonged to an order and that his one-man cell was "activated" by another clandestine cell.[336]
>
>On 14 August 2012, several Norwegian politicians and media outlets received an email from someone claiming to be Breivik's "deputy", demanding that Breivik be released and making more threats against Norwegian society.[337]

>Al-Qaeda operative Luai Sakra apparently begins working as an informant for the CIA, Syrian intelligence, and Turkish intelligence. Sakra, a young Syrian whose parents were Turkish, attended the Khaldan training camp in Afghanistan in 1997. He developed a bond with Abu Zubaida, the al-Qaeda leader who was logistics manager for the camp. Zubaida will later be captured and interrogated by the CIA and will reportedly confirm a link with Sakra. Zubaida tasked Sakra with building up an al-Qaeda network in Turkey. In 1999, the Syrian government began hunting him for his role in a revolt in a Lebanon refugee camp. [DER SPIEGEL (HAMBURG), 8/24/2005] The Turkish newspaper Zaman will report shortly after his capture in 2005, “Sakra has been sought by the secret services since 2000.” The CIA interrogated him twice in 2000. “Following the interrogation, the CIA offered him employment. He also received a large sum of money by the CIA. However the CIA eventually lost contact with him. Following this development, in 2000 the CIA passed intelligence about Sakra through a classified notice to Turkey, calling for the Turkish (intelligence) to capture him. [They] caught Sakra in Turkey and interrogated him.” [ZAMAN, 8/14/2005] Sakra was then apparently let go again. He will then move Germany and assist some of the 9/11 hijackers (see September 2000-July 24, 2001), then reveal details about the 9/11 attacks to Syrian intelligence the day before 9/11 (see September 10, 2001). He also will later claim to have trained some 9/11 hijackers in Turkey starting in late 1999 (see Late 1999-2000). In 2007, former CIA Director George Tenet will write in his book “At the Center of the Storm” that “a source we were jointly running with a Middle Eastern country went to see his foreign handler and basically told him something big was about to go down.” [TENET, 2007, PP. 160] This is very likely a reference to Sakra, since no one else comes close to matching the description of telling a Middle Eastern government about the 9/11 attacks one day in advance, not to mention working as an informant for the CIA at the same time. Tenet’s revelation strongly supports the notion that Sakra in fact accepted the CIA’s offers in 2000 and had been working with the CIA and other intelligence agencies at least through 9/11.

>Lead 7/7 suicide bomber Mohammed Sidique Khan (see July 7, 2005) first attends the radical Finsbury Park mosque in London in 2002. The mosque is run by extremist imam Abu Hamza al-Masri, an informer for Britain’s security services (see Early 1997). Khan and fellow suicide bomber Shehzad Tanweer first heard Abu Hamza preach in Leeds, and when Khan arrives at the mosque he is carrying a letter of recommendation from Haroon Rashid Aswat, a top aide to Abu Hamza, an alleged mastermind of the 7/7 bombings, and a possible British informant (see Late June-July 7, 2005 and July 29, 2005). Reportedly, Khan makes several visits to the mosque, sometimes sleeping in the basement. Aswat recruited young men to join al-Qaeda at Finsbury Park, at least in the late 1990s (see Late 1990s). Khan also takes Tanweer to the mosque, where, according to authors Sean O’Neill and Daniel McGrory, they are “shown gory videos and DVDs portraying the suffering and slaughter of Muslims in hotspots around the world, and [are] urged to make common cause with the people of Chechnya, Iraq, and Afghanistan.” O’Neill and McGrory will later comment: “Instructors at Finsbury Park would have spotted that in Khan they had a small-time street boss who was an ideal candidate to organize his own cell.” Khan, Tanweer, and a third bomber, Jermaine Lindsay, will also attend gatherings led by Abu Hamza outside the mosque after it is closed by police (see January 24, 2003).

6. [Haroon Ashid Aswat is an MI6 double agent - YouTube [4 minutes]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxPY3H5EqA&t=74s)
>In an interview on Fox News, counterterrorism expert John Loftus claims that Haroon Rashid Aswat, named in recent reports as the mastermind of the 7/7 London bombings earlier in the month (see July 7, 2005), is actually an agent of the British intelligence agency MI6. Loftus says: “[W]hat’s really embarrassing is that the entire British police are out chasing [Aswat], and one wing of the British government, MI6 or the British Secret Service, has been hiding him. And this has been a real source of contention between the CIA, the Justice Department, and Britain.… He’s a double agent.” The interviewer clarifies, “So he’s working for the Brits to try to give them information about al-Qaeda, but in reality he’s still an al-Qaeda operative.” Loftus replies: “Yeah. The CIA and the Israelis all accused MI6 of letting all these terrorists live in London not because they’re getting al-Qaeda information, but for appeasement. It was one of those you leave us alone, we leave you alone kind of things.” Loftus then explains that Aswat has been wanted by US prosecutors in Seattle since 2002 for attempting to help set up a training camp in Oregon (see November 1999-Early 2000). “[W]e’ve just learned that the headquarters of the US Justice Department ordered the Seattle prosecutors not to touch Aswat [because] apparently Aswat was working for British intelligence. Now Aswat’s boss, the one-armed [London imam Abu Hamza al-Masri], he gets indicted two years later. So the guy above him and below him get indicted, but not Aswat. Now there’s a split of opinion within US intelligence. Some people say that the British intelligence fibbed to us. They told us that Aswat was dead, and that’s why the New York group dropped the case. That’s not what most of the Justice Department thinks. They think that it was just again covering up for this very publicly affiliated guy with [the British militant group] Al-Muhajiroun. He was a British intelligence plant. So all of a sudden he disappears. He’s in South Africa. We think he’s dead; we don’t know he’s down there. Last month the South African Secret Service come across the guy. He’s alive.” The host asks: “Yeah, now the CIA says, oh he’s alive. Our CIA says OK let’s arrest him. But the Brits say no again?” Loftus replies: “The Brits say no. Now at this point, two weeks ago, the Brits know that the CIA wants to get a hold of Haroon. So what happens? He takes off again, goes right to London. He isn’t arrested when he lands, he isn’t arrested when he leaves. [Even though] he’s on the watch list. The only reason he could get away with that was if he was working for British intelligence. He was a wanted man.” Loftus finally explains that Aswat’s relationship with British intelligence began in the late 1990s with the war in Kosovo. The US, Britain, and radical Muslims were all on the same side, helping the Muslims in Kosovo fight the Serbians. Loftus says that Al-Muhajiroun was involved in recruiting British Muslims to fight in Kosovo, and Aswat was part of that effort. [FOX NEWS, 7/29/2005] Two days after Loftus’s comments, the Sunday Times reports that senior British officials “deny ‘any knowledge’ that he might be an agent for either MI5 or MI6.” [SUNDAY TIMES (LONDON), 7/31/2005]

3. [GROW (support group) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GROW_(support_group))
>GROW is a peer support and mutual-aid organization for recovery from, and prevention of, serious mental illness. GROW was founded in Sydney, Australia in 1957 by Father Cornelius B. "Con" Keogh, a Roman Catholic priest, and psychiatric patients who sought help with their mental illness in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Consequently, GROW adapted many of AA's principles and practices. As the organization matured, GROW members learned of Recovery International, an organization also created to help people with serious mental illness, and integrated pieces of its will-training methods.[1][2] As of 2005 there were more than 800 GROW groups active worldwide.[3] GROW groups are open to anyone who would like to join, though they specifically seek out those who have a history of psychiatric hospitalization or are socioeconomically disadvantaged. Despite the capitalization, GROW is not an acronym.[4] Much of GROW's initial development was made possible with support from Orval Hobart Mowrer, Reuben F. Scarf, W. Clement Stone and Lions Clubs International.[2]

4. [Orval Hobart Mowrer - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orval_Hobart_Mowrer)
>Orval Hobart Mowrer (January 23, 1907 – June 20, 1982) was an American psychologist and professor of psychology at the University of Illinois from 1948 to 1975 known for his research on behaviour therapy. Mowrer practiced psychotherapy in Champaign-Urbana and at Galesburg State Research Hospital.[when?][1] In 1954 Mowrer held the position of president of the American Psychological Association.[2] Mowrer founded Integrity Groups (therapeutic community groups based on principles of honesty, responsibility, and emotional involvement)[3] and was instrumental in establishing GROW groups in the United States.[4] A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Mowrer as the 98th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.[5]

5. [Orval Hobart Mowrer - War work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orval_Hobart_Mowrer#War_work)
>In 1944 Mowrer became a psychologist at the Office of Strategic Services developing assessment techniques for potential intelligence agents.[9] Mowrer's experience with the laboratory induction of psychological stress, along with the work of other psychologists, was utilized to construct an environment in which recruits could be assessed for their ability to withstand highly stressful situations.[15]
>
>As part of his work there, he participated in a seminar led by Harry Stack Sullivan. Sullivan's theories on the role of disturbances in interpersonal relationships with "significant others" in the etiology of mental disorders had a profound effect on Mowrer's thinking. When Mowrer returned to Harvard, he began counseling students in addition to his faculty duties. He used the principles he had learned from Sullivan, questioning them about their interpersonal relationships and confronting them when he felt they were being dishonest.[9]

>In 1947, after his business had grown significantly, Stone built the Combined Insurance Company of America, which provided both accident and health insurance coverage.[3] By 1979, his insurance company exceeded $1 billion in assets. Combined later merged with the Ryan Insurance Group to form Aon Corporation in 1987,[2] and Combined was later spun off by Aon to ACE Limited in April 2008 for $2.56 billion.[4]\

>Stone contributed up to $10 million to President Richard Nixon's election campaigns in 1968 and 1972; they were cited in Congressional debates after the Watergate scandal to institute campaign spending limits.[1]
>
>According to Tim Weiner, in One Man Against the World: The Tragedy of Richard Nixon, in 1972 President Nixon's lawyer, Herbert Kalmbach, helped raise money for Nixon's presidential campaign by selling ambassadorships to large donors, including "W. Clement Stone, [who] pledged $3 million." Stone wanted to become ambassador to Great Britain, "which already was occupied by Ambassador Walter Annenberg, who gave $254,000 in order to stay on" (p. 160).\

1. [Omar Mateen - Early life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Mateen#Early_life)
>Mateen was born Omar Mir Seddique[2] on November 16, 1986,[8] at Long Island Jewish Medical Center[9][10] in New Hyde Park, New York, to Afghan parents. His father, Mir Seddique Mateen, is from Herat[11] who emigrated from Afghanistan in the 1980s[12][13][14] and became a naturalized US citizen on November 17, 1989.[10] Seddique Mateen was a secret informant for the FBI at times between January 2005 and June 2016.[15] Seddique Mateen also owns a non-profit company named The Durand Jirga, Inc. based in Port St. Lucie, Florida, which was founded in 2010 where he hosted a political commentary show.[16] His mother, Shahla Mateen, was taken into custody after she allegedly attacked her husband while he was brushing his teeth on the night of December 7, 2002.[17] Both of his parents first settled in New York, having four children, including Omar.[18] After being raised in New York for a few years, he moved with his family to Port St. Lucie, Florida in 1991.[11] His family was described as being moderate Muslims and "all-American."[19]

2. [Omar Mateen - Post-secondary education and employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Mateen#Post-secondary_education_and_employment)
>In October 2006, Mateen began working as a recruit for the Florida Department of Corrections, being assigned to the Martin Correctional Institution. In a letter explaining his juvenile record as part of his successful application, Mateen explained the incident of when he was arrested at school when he was fourteen. He also wrote that he had experimented with marijuana as a young teenager. Following the Virginia Tech shooting in April 2007, Mateen suggested in a corrections officer training class that he would bring a gun to class. P.H. Skipper, who was the warden at the institution, wrote that "in light of the tragic events at Virginia Tech officer Mateen's inquiry about bringing a weapon to class is at best extremely disturbing." Days later on April 27, 2007, Mateen "was involuntarily dismissed" from the program and never became a certified corrections officer.[22][28][30][31]
>
>Mateen then worked for British-based security firm G4S Secure Solutions in Jupiter, Florida, from September 2007 until his death.[21][32][33][34]
>
>In 2010, Mateen, while working for G4S, was interviewed for and appears in The Big Fix, the 2012 documentary about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[35][36] Mateen said of those working on the cleanup: "Nobody gives a shit here. Everybody's just, get out to get paid. They're like hoping for more oil to come out and more people to complain so they'll have jobs. They want more disaster to happen."[37][38]

3. [Omar Mateen - Screening issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Mateen#Screening_issues)
>G4S said two screenings of Mateen—one conducted upon hiring and the other in 2013—had raised no red flags.[39] Under Florida state law, for him to work as an armed guard the company was required either to make a full psychiatric evaluation of Mateen, or to administer a "validated written psychological test".[40] The test administered was the updated Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2), a test used for job screenings and court cases requiring those subjected to it to agree or disagree with statements such as "My soul sometimes leaves my body" and "Once in a while I think of things too bad to talk about."[40] Carol Nudelman, the psychologist listed on the character certification submitted by G4S to the state, said she stopped working for the company in 2005. After the shooting, Nudelman, who according to the records of the security company G4S, was said to have evaluated and cleared Mateen for his firearms license in 2007, denied ever meeting him or having lived in Florida at the time, and said she had stopped her practice in Florida in January 2006. G4S said Mateen was not actually interviewed by a psychologist, but rather, a psychologist evaluated the results of a standard test used in job screenings and his test was evaluated by the firm that bought Nudelman's practice, Headquarters for Psychological Evaluation.[41][42]
>
>On September 10, 2016, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services fined G4S $151,400 for providing inaccurate psychological testing information after it found the psychologist whose opinion was necessary to permit Mateen to carry a weapon was not practicing as a screener. Between 2006 and 2016, 1,514 forms were submitted erroneously listing Nudelman's name. Mateen's form was among those investigated.[43] He had taken the MMPI-2 and Dr. Syed Shafeeq Rahman, a family physician who had close ties with Mateen's family, gave him a medical clearance.[20] Rahman was also the imam of the Fort Pierce mosque to which the family belonged and said that Mateen had become progressively more "reclusive," and did not speak to other congregants before or after services.[44] G4S admitted Mateen's form had a "clerical error", and clarified that he had instead been cleared by Rahman, who was from the same firm that bought the wrongly named doctor's practice. Rahman had not interviewed Mateen, but evaluated the results of a standard test used in the screening he undertook before being hired.[45] Nonetheless, G4S removed Mateen from his job post at a courthouse because of threats he made towards coworkers, including one threat where he claimed he would have al-Qaeda kill a deputy's family.[46][47] Mateen had claimed that his coworkers and courthouse deputies were making racist comments towards him.[47] Despite this, G4S "kept Mateen as an employee" but moved him "to a kiosk at a gated community in Palm Beach County."[45] They never informed the community or its property management company about why he was transferred there.[47]
>
>Mateen held an active concealed carry permit and an armed security guard license.[48][49] It was also noted that Mateen had no adult criminal record.[50] According to licensing records, he was a proficient shooter who scored at or above the 98th percentile with a 9mm semiautomatic pistol.[51]

>The US-Afghan military industrial complex surrounding Orlando terrorist Omar Mateen’s father stretches from Blackwater to Donald Trump.\
>[...]\
>This investigation throws light on the complex political, cultural, religious and personal forces that likely nurtured the Orlando terrorist into a man capable of tremendous violence. 
>
>The story opens up from an exclusive analysis of the network of companies surrounding Omar Mateen’s father.
>
>Company records obtained by INSURGE intelligence reveal that Mateen’s father has longstanding ties to a network of powerful Afghan expatriates connected to the US government, private American defense contractors, and pro-Taliban warlords.\
>[...]\
>Omar Mateen had also worked as an armed security officer for G4S — the world’s largest government security contractor by revenues — for the last 9 years.
>
>G4S in Florida has been contracted by the US State Department and British Foreign Office for security operations in Afghanistan.
>
>In 2010, a US Senate investigation heavily criticized the State Department for hiring G4S subsidiary ArmorGroup, which had been sub-contracting Afghan warlords tied to the Taliban and al-Qaeda to outsource certain security functions.\
>[...]\
>Omar Mateen’s father, Mir Seddique Mateen, is part of a network of influential Afghan expatriates working closely with a vast range of US government departments and agencies. The expatriates also have direct connections to the US-backed government in Afghanistan, as well as with warlords opposed to the Afghan regime and sympathetic to the Taliban.
>
>Some of these expatriates were close to the late Mohammed Zahir Shah, the last King of Afghanistan, who was deposed in a 1973 coup covertly backed by the Soviet Union. As such, they were at first particularly close to the Hamid Karzai regime in Kabul, which had appointed many of Shah’s relatives to government posts.
>
>According to Ahmad Saeedi, a political analyst in Kabul, Omar Mateen’s father, Mir Seddique Mateen, fought in the Afghan jihad to expel the Soviet invasion, before emigrating to the US thirty-one years ago:
>
>“A fierce anti-communist, Mateen was a captain in the ranks of the mujahedeen who fought the Soviet occupation, Saeedi said. Once in the US, he promoted himself to the rank of general.”
>
>Successive US administrations at the time poured billions of dollars into the Afghan war against the Soviets. Among the mujahideen who benefited from the US policy were Osama bin Laden, who used the networks built-up during the Cold War to create his al-Qaeda terrorist network.
>
>Omar Mateen was, in other words, the son of an ex-mujahid who fought to repel the Soviet Army from Afghanistan.
>
>Mir Seddique Mateen is now a founding director of a number of seemingly innocuous US nonprofit companies relating to Afghanistan. Yet these companies provide a surprising window into Mir Seddique’s connections to a powerful network of Afghan expatriates.
>
>Those Afghan figures, in turn, have links to both the US-backed Afghan jihad during the Cold War, as well as to senior figures involved in the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan.
>
>Some of these details have been reported sporadically by journalists, but none have grasped their alarming significance.
>
>Hail to the King\
>Among Mir Seddique’s companies, the most relevant is The Durand Jirga Inc., which was incorporated on 30th November 2010. The company’s Articles of Incorporation say that The Durand Jirga Inc. is “organized for exclusively religious, charitable, educational and scientific purposes… Specifically, the organization will mediate and attempt to resolve social and territorial disputes.”
>
>The company name is a reference to the historic ‘Durand Line’, the disputed boundary between Afghanistan and Pakistan established by the British in 1893 that stretches between ethnic Pashtuns, Baloch, Uzbek, and other ethnic groups residing on both sides.
>
>The late King Shah, who died in 2007, had at various times questioned and even renounced the Durand Line as an invalid colonial boundary that had permitted Pakistan to occupy Afghan territory. During his reign until 1973, he frequently delivered pro-Pashtunistan speeches extolling a nationalist Afghan vision rejecting the Durand Line.
>
>This is precisely the position adopted by Omar Mateen’s father, Mir Seddique, in his occasional TV show broadcast via ‘Payam-e-Afghan’, a satellite television network based in Los Angeles, California, aimed at Afghan expatriates.
>
>In 2010, one of Mir Seddique’s directors at Durand Jirga Inc. was Qasim Tarin. In the aftermath of the Orlando killings, Tarin was sought out by some journalists, and insisted that the gunman’s father was “obviously against Taliban and ISIS and all that.”
>
>“I’ve known him for a long time,” said Tarin, who also appeared on Mir Seddique’s TV show. “To his Facebook and all, he is absolutely against ISIS and Pakistanis and, of course, ISI intelligence.”
>
>Mir Seddique has frequently criticized the Taliban, but has also occasionally praised the group when he saw it as potentially undermining Pakistan.
>
>“Our brothers in Waziristan, our warrior brothers in [the] Taliban movement and national Afghan Taliban are rising up,” he said in one broadcast. “Inshallah, the Durand Line issue will be solved soon.”
>
>Mir Seddique’s ‘old friend’ and the US-Afghan military industrial complex\
>But Qasim Tarin is far more than just an old friend of the Orlando terrorist’s father. During his stint on the board of Mir Siddique’s Durand Jirga Inc., he was simultaneously on the Board of Directors at the Afghan-American Chamber of Commerce. In 2011, he became Interim President of the AACC’s Northern California Chapter, then became permanent president in 2012.
>
>Tarin resigned from his directorship at The Durand Jirga that year to focus on the new role, but remained close friends with Mir Siddique.
>
>The Afghan-American Chamber of Commerce was founded in 2002, months after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan. It is basically a key forum for the US-Afghan military industrial complex.
>
>Sponsored by the US State Department, Commerce Department, and USAID, the AACC’s board includes Col. James L. Bullion, former Director of the Pentagon’s Task Force for Business and Stability Operations; Marine Corps Major General (ret.) Arnold Fields, the former US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR); Jeffrey Grieco, former Chief of Communications and Government Affairs (2009–14) for International Relief & Development (IRD), an NGO “implementer” for the Department of State and US Agency for International Development (USAID); Ambassador Said Tayeb Jawad who served as President Karzai’s Press Secretary, Chief of Staff and Director of the Office of International Relations; former Congressman Don Ritter, who as the Chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Afghanistan was one of the main architects of the US strategy to support the Afghan mujahideen during the Soviet invasion and occupation.
>
>The AACC’s LinkedIn profile says that the Chamber:
>
>“… advocates for a market economy in Afghanistan… and serves as a link between business and government to encourage economic policies that will result in increased business and investment between the US and Afghanistan.”
>
>The AACC organizes regular ‘business matchmaking’ conferences to facilitate US private sector investment in Afghanistan. These conferences have been sponsored by major US defense contractors like DynCorp International, SOS International LLC (where former Bush administration deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz sits on the Board of Advisors), as well as other private sector firms.
>
>While Mir Seddique is not a member of the AACC, the Chamber is co-directed by his friend Qasim Tarin. Both Tarin and Mir Seddique have also worked together as part of the Unity and Freedom Movement of Afghanistan (UFMOA), an expatriate Afghan lobbying group which has drawn extensively on Tarin’s connections to the US-Afghan military industrial complex to organize meetings with Washington insiders.
>
>From Donald Trump to Zalmay Khalilzad\
>It is perhaps ironic that both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, who have issued predictably inflammatory remarks blaming American Muslims for the Orlando attack, find themselves plugged into the same US-Afghan military industrial complex surrounding Omar Mateen’s father.
>
>In 2009, at the AACC’s fifth annual business matchmaking conference in Washington DC, one panel on ‘Cooperating with DoD [Department of Defense] on Economic Development’ was chaired by Joseph Schmitz, a former Pentagon Chief Inspector General who was now working with SIGAR in Afghanistan.
>
>Joseph Schmitz went on to become a Senior Fellow at the neoconservative Center for Security Policy (CSP) run by former Reagan Pentagon official Frank Gaffney. Gaffney was most recently the National Security Advisor to Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz. As for Schmitz, he is now Foreign Policy Advisor to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
>
>Schmitz, along with AACC executive Arnold Fields, previously succeeded in dramatically failing to exert meaningful oversight over the US government’s dubious contracts with private defense firms.
>
>It was not until the US Senate investigated, for instance, that it emerged that Omar Mateen’s employer G4S had sub-contracted security services to Afghan warlords linked “to murder, kidnapping, bribery, and anti-Coalition activities.”
>
>Unlike the US government’s own inspector generals, the Senate report found that G4S was well-aware of their connections with the Taliban, but hired them anyway.
>
>At the CSP, Schmitz made-up for his lack of concern about the US government sub-contracting to pro-Taliban extremists by co-authoring a bizarre report claiming that Shari’ah law was literally on the brink of taking over the United States.
>
>Equally bizarre, Schmitz’s co-author was former CIA director R. James Woolsey, who was previously Senior Vice President at NSA-contractor Booz Allen Hamilton.
>
>This May, the AACC’s 14th general annual meeting in Virginia hosted former Ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and the UN, Zalmay Khalilzad as a keynote speaker. Khalilzad is a longtime senior Pentagon official who played a key role in US assistance to Islamist mujahideen networks in Afghanistan during the Cold War (and in the Balkans after the Cold War). He was also a major force in the Bush administration’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
>
>Khalilzad’s wife, Cheryl Benard, was until recently a direct colleague of Qasim Tarin as a board member of the AACC, where she led one of the Chamber’s working groups. She resigned from the AACC board after it emerged that both Khalilzad and Benard were being investigated that year by US and Austrian authorities as part of a multi-million dollar money-laundering probe.

>From Blackwater to DynCorp\
>Qasim Tarin’s other connections could throw some light on the fraught political context in which Omar Mateen transitioned from a student into adulthood.

>The company was registered to the same address as several other companies controlled by Tarin at one time or other: the Afghan Business Network, which Tarin founded and ran for nearly a year in 2010; the Unity and Freedom Movement of Afghanistan; the Afghan International Development Corp; and the Wahidullah Ahmed Zai (WAZ) Group.
>
>The WAZ Group is an especially useful indicator of the nature of Tarin’s network of companies. A fuel supply and logistics company registered with Afghanistan’s trade ministry, the firm’s clients include the present government of Afghanistan, the US Department of Defense, several private US military contractors including the notorious Blackwater (now Academi) and DynCorp, as well as the US Army’s Special Forces.
>
>As such, the WAZ Group is directly complicit in the Obama administration’s continuing stealth occupation of Afghanistan. In 2012, the firm formerly known as Blackwater won a no-bid $22 million 3-year contract to provide logistical support for the US Special Operations Joint Task Force compound in Kabul, Camp Integrity.
>
>The uncle of jihad\
>Tarin is still a registered agent for all these companies, and his company Electro Imaging Systems Inc., is the registered address for all of them.
>
>The Afghan Business Network is run by Tarin’s colleague, Homayoun Rahnoma, who is the Interim Vice President of the Afghan American Chamber of Commerce.
>
>The Unity and Freedom Movement of Afghanistan (UFMOA) is another active nonprofit company incorporated in 2012, whose President is Dr. Abdul Sattar Sirat — the former Minister of Justice in Afghanistan under the late King Shah until the 1973 coup.
>
>The UFMOA’s Facebook page describes itself as “the first Afghan Political Advocacy and Lobbyist group”, and confirms that the group has been politically active in Afghanistan, regularly sending delegations to Kabul led by Dr. Sirat.
>
>In the wake of the US occupation of Afghanistan and the efforts to transition to a new government, Dr. Sirat was among several political candidates, including Hamid Karzai, who were considered to be potential viable national leaders.
>
>The UFMOA’s fundamental agenda is consistent with the ‘Durand Line’ issue adopted by the late King Shah himself — namely to rollback perceived Pakistani influence in Afghanistan through the Taliban.
>
>But while this might at first glance appear to be relatively harmless, Sirat’s various affiliations over time demonstrate that the movement’s overall concern is not the Taliban as such — but the role of Pakistan in using groups like the Taliban as forces for proxy influence.
>
>Thus, when Sirat was the initial presidential candidate in the late king’s US-UN backed delegation to lead an interim Afghan administration, although he ran as an ‘independent,’ he did so in a joint alliance with Mohammad Amin Waqad — a former deputy of the terrorist faction Hezb-e-Islami Gulbeddin — who stood for the post of first vice-president under a prospective Sirat presidency.
>
>Hezb-e-Islami Gulbeddin is an extremist Islamist mujahideen faction formed in Afghanistan in 1975 to fight the Soviet occupation. Its founder and leader, is Gulbeddin Hekmatyar, a US designated global terrorist. During the Cold War, Hekmatyar’s Hezb-e-Islami received extensive support from the CIA, Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), and Saudi intelligence, while he worked closely with Osama bin Laden.
>
>Sirat’s willingness to work with Hezb-e-Islami — which was credited with slaughtering far more rival Afghan mujahideen than Soviet soldiers — comes from his personal history of having worked at a high level in Saudi Arabia to facilitate funding for the Afghan resistance.
>
>From 1975 to 1999, Sirat was Professor of Islamic Studies at Um-al-Qura University in Riyadh. He was also a Special Advisor to the Saudi King. According to Alhaj Nasrullah Barekzai, the director of Wahdat-e-Milli-ye-Aqwam-e-Afghanistan (the National Union of Tribes of Afghanistan):
>
>“Sirat was called the uncle of jihad because all [mujahideen] leaders were looking to his funds and the money he collected for them. This title was given [to him] by Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi.”
>
>Maulana Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi was the leader of the Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami (Islamic Revolution Movement), a major traditionalist Islamist movement backed by the US through the Saudis to expel the USSR from Afghanistan. He played a pivotal leadership role in the wider mujahideen movement, having served as Vice President of Afghanistan from 1992 to 1996 in the Mujahideen government.
>
>Though Mohammadi was himself a relative “moderate” according to foreign affairs scholar Banafsheh Keynoush, author of Saudi Arabia and Iran: Friends or Foes?, he “helped train many would-be Taliban leaders.” (p. 111)
>
>When the Taliban conquered the bulk of Afghanistan in 1996, Mohammadi maintained good relations with the movement. Most of the movement’s leaders, including Mullah Omar, had been Mohammadi’s students.
>
>Sirat is also related by marriage to Yunus Qanuni, the spokesman for the Northern Alliance, the Afghan warlord network opposed to the Taliban. The initial US-UN vision was to bring in Sirat as leader of a transitional government that would unite the Northern Alliance and other tribal factions in opposition to the Taliban.
>
>But according to the Revolutionary Association of Women in Afghanistan (RAWA), the oldest women’s humanitarian and political organization in the country, the sheen of legitimacy the US and UN had tried to grant to the new proposed Abdul Sattar Sirat regime was disingeous. The Northern Alliance, said Tahmeena Faryal of RAWA:
>
>“… have the blood of our beloved people on their hands, as of course do the Taliban… From 1992 to 1996 in particular, these forces waged a brutal war against women, using rape, torture, abduction and forced marriage as their weapons.”
>
>In the end, Sirat was pressured by the US to withdraw his candidacy during the 2001 US-brokered transition process — purportedly over concerns about the ethnic balance of the incoming government, and the unlikelihood of his victory. The move allowed the more charismatic (and corrupt) Hamid Karzai, the US preferred option, to step in.
>
>Disillusioned uncle of jihad\
>While Sirat and his fellow royalists — including Omar Mateen’s father and his friend Qasim Tarin — had at first embraced Karzai’s interim government with enthusiasm, his rampant corruption amidst credible allegations of flawed or fraudulent elections fueled growing criticisms of the US-backed regime, and of US policy in Afghanistan generally.
>
>In 2004, widespread evidence of fraud plagued Afghanistan’s first national elections. Sirat was among the 15 other presidential candidates who, in the middle of the voting, withdrew from the elections in outrage. “Today’s election is not a legitimate election. It should be stopped and we don’t recognise the results,” Sirat said at the time. “This vote is a fraud and any government formed from it is illegitimate.”
>
>Karzai’s eventual replacement by the presidency of Ashraf Ghani was, therefore, at first cautiously welcomed as a potential positive step, but ongoing corruption allegations led to a resurgence of disillusionment in the expatriate Afghan community around Sirat.
>
>Such context of growing disillusionment with US policy, perceived as a form of ceaseless, disastrous, counter-democratic interference, led Sirat to participate in Paris talks in 2012 hosted by French think-tank, the Foundation for Strategic Research. Sirat himself was present at the talks with delegates representing both the Taliban and Hekmatyar.
>
>The view of Omar Mateen’s father Mir Seddique and other expatriates around Abdul Sattar Sirat is that due to the dysfunctional nature of the incumbent US-backed Ashraf Ghani regime in Afghanistan, a Loya Jirga — a traditional Afghan grand assembly of tribal leaders — should be convened to kick-start a new transitional process to a more ‘legitimate’ government.
>
>‘Legitimate’ implies a government more focused on anti-Pakistan Afghan nationalism, and ready therefore to take a hardline on the Durand Line issue.
>
>This appears to be the context of Mir Seddique’s stated political aspirations to stand as a presidential candidate.
>
>Omar Mateen’s father met with senior US and British government officials\
>This investigation lends some clarity to the task of understanding the cultural context of Omar Mateen’s upbringing. His father, whom he had much respect for, was not just a former mujahid in Afghanistan, but an active member of Abdul ‘uncle of jihad’ Sirat’s UFMOA.
>
>Photographs obtained from Mir Seddique’s Facebook profile, as well as from the UFMOA Facebook page, show that his connection with Qasim Tarin and Abdul Sirat provided him extensive access to senior political figures in the US. Several photos picture Mir Seddique as a member of UFMOA lobbying delegations to Washington.
>
>The photographs show that in the last few years, Mir Seddique had been able to meet senior US government officials at events and lobbying meetings in Congress, the US State Department, and the British embassy in Washington DC — as late as April 2016.
>
>Mir Seddique did not respond to request for clarification on which government officials he met in these meetings, and why.
>
>The Daily Mail has posted some of these photos showing Mir Seddique with senior Congressional figures such as Dana Rohrabacher, the Republican stalwart who played a major role in the US government’s Cold War support for the Afghan mujahideen.\
>[...]\
>In one photo that was posted with an earlier version of the Daily Mail article — but which is no longer available — Mir Seddique can be seen posing next to Abdul Sattar Sirat as part of a UFMOA gathering.
>
>Many other key photographs released here exclusively raise further questions about the extent of Mir Seddique’s access to Washington officialdom due to his work with Sirat and Tarin.
>
>In the below photos (dated 15th January 2015), Mir Seddique can be seen attending a meeting at the British embassy in Washington DC. In the first, he is accompanied by two British military officers, one of whom is described as the UK Ministry of Defence’s ‘military attache’, along with his wife.
>
>The current British Defence Attache is Major General Richard Cripwell who works with Minister (Defense Material) Steve McCarthy — neither of whom are the individuals in the photo alongside Seddique Mateen.
>
>If Mir Seddique’s description is remotely accurate, the two unidentified individuals will be members of the British Defence Staff at the UK embassy, although this has not yet been independently verified. The British embassy in Washington DC has offered no comment on the photograph.
>
>Another photo shows Mir Seddique next to another unnamed man described only as the Deputy Director of Central European Affairs at the US State Department.
>
>This appears to be a sensitive US government position as no official information is publicly available about the role.
>
>INSURGE intelligence has, however, been able to confirm that the Deputy Director of the Office of Central European Affairs — an agency in the State Department’s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs headed up by Assistant Secretary Victoria Nuland — is Henry Martin McDowell.
>
>McDowell was previously (2013–14) Special Assistant to the Under-Secretary for Political Affairs at the State Department.
>
>There is, however, no public information about McDowell’s role at the State Department.
>
>The British embassy in Washington DC was asked to comment on Mir Seddique’s attendance at the 2015 event, where he met top UK defense and US State Department staff. Details about the event and its guest-list were requested, but the embassy has failed to respond.
>
>In another photo on the UMFOA’s Facebook page dated 2013, Qasim Tarin and other UMFOA members are said to be at a gathering where they will meet Vice President Joe Biden.
>
>In short, Omar Mateen’s father was part of an extraordinarily well-connected network of Afghan expatriates, who were not just leftovers from the US-backed Afghan jihad during the Cold War, but were also key players in a post-9/11 US-Afghan military-industrial complex.

>Omar Mateen, whose bloody siege inside a packed Orlando gay nightclub ended when SWAT teams stormed the building and killed him, was a radical Muslim who followed Marcus Dwayne Robertson, a law enforcement source said.
>
>“It is no coincidence that this happened in Orlando,” said a law enforcement source familiar with Robertson’s history of recruiting terrorists and inciting violence. “Mateen was enrolled in [Robertson’s online] Fundamental Islamic Knowledge Seminary.”\

>[...]\
>After he was arrested in 1991 [...] prosecutors cut a deal with Robertson, and let him serve four years in prison before going to work undercover for the FBI between 2004 and 2007 to document terrorists’ plans and networks in Africa, Egypt and the United States.\

>Mateen in 2007, as part of the G4S hiring screening process, underwent a standard psychological exam — named the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory — and a background check, its representatives said. The state also screened Mateen every two years in order for him to keep his private security license. Beyond that, G4S does not conduct yearly background checks of its employees; rather, 15 percent of all employees are randomly checked each year, representatives said.
>
>Mateen's background, however, was checked again by G4S in 2013 after the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office requested he be removed from the St. Lucie County Courthouse patrol after he allegedly made derogatory comments to a deputy.
>
>A deputy at the courthouse mentioned the Middle East to Mateen, who reacted by threatening the deputy, said Sheriff Ken Mascara, who attended the Wednesday night meeting at the community's Island Club.
>
>"Omar became very agitated and made a comment that he could have al-Qaida kill my employee and his family," Mascara said Wednesday. "If that wasn't bad enough, he followed it up with very disturbing comments about women and followed it up with very disturbing comments about Jews and then went on to say that the Fort Hood shooter was justified in his actions."
>
>The FBI launched an investigation into Mateen after Sheriff's Office officials reported the incident to the agency. As part of its investigation, the FBI examined Mateen's travel history, phone records, acquaintances and even planted a confidential informant in the courthouse to "lure Omar into some kind of act and Omar did not bite," Mascara said. The FBI concluded Mateen was not a threat after that, Mascara said.

2. June 1996-February 1997: British Intelligence Recruits Prominent Al-Qaeda Imam Abu Qatada
http://web.archive.org/web/20201030171821/http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a0696qatada#a0696qatada
>In June and December 1996, and again in February 1997, a British MI5 agent meets with radical Muslim imam Abu Qatada, hoping he will inform on his fellow extremists. Qatada is a Jordanian national who entered Britain in September 1993 using a forged United Arab Emirates passport, and was granted asylum in 1994.
>
>Qatada Promises to Look after British Interests - In his meetings with the MI5 agent he claims to “wield powerful, spiritual influence over the Algerian community in London.” He says he does not want London to become a center for settling Islamic scores, and that he will report anyone damaging British interests. He says the individuals he has influence over pose no threat to British security, and promises that “he would not bite the hand that fed him.” He also promises to “report anyone damaging the interests of [Britain].” The MI5 agent records that “surprisingly enough—[Abu Qatada] revealed little love of the methodology and policies pursued by Osama bin Laden. He certainly left me with the impression that he had nothing but contempt for bin Laden’s distant financing of the jihad.” [SPECIAL IMMIGRATION APPEALS COMMISSION, 1/2004 pdf file; CHANNEL 4 NEWS (LONDON), 3/23/2004; GUARDIAN, 3/24/2004; LONDON TIMES, 3/25/2004]
>
>Links to Al-Qaeda - Yet Qatada is later described as being a “key [British] figure” in al-Qaeda related terror activity. Around 1996, a highly reliable informer told US intelligence that Qatada is on al-Qaeda’s fatwa (religious) committee (see June 1996-1997). Videos of his sermons are later discovered in the Hamburg flat used by Mohamed Atta. Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, and Zacarias Moussaoui, who is later convicted in connection with the 9/11 attacks, are alleged to have sought religious advice from him. [BBC, 8/11/2005; GUARDIAN, 8/11/2005]
>
>Meetings Apparently Continue - Reportedly, after Qatada’s February 1997 meeting with the British agent, no further such meetings occur. [SPECIAL IMMIGRATION APPEALS COMMISSION, 1/2004 pdf file] However, some French officials later allege that Qatada continues to be an MI5 agent, and this is what allows him to avoid arrest after 9/11 (see Early December 2001). [OBSERVER, 2/24/2002] It will later emerge that Bisher al-Rawi, a friend of Qatada, served as an informant and a go-between MI5 and Qatada in numerous meetings between late 2001 and 2002, when Qatada is finally arrested (see Late September 2001-Summer 2002). Furthermore, al-Rawi says he served as a translator between MI5 and Qatada before 9/11, suggesting that Qatada never stopped being an informant. [OBSERVER, 7/29/2007]

He was part of Majlis Shura al-Mujahideen, a group led by Abu Atheer al-Absi. He is described as one of the first to have pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after the dispute between IS and Jabhat al-Nusra.

He was said to be one of the first Muslim Swedes to have left the country to join ISIS. In January 2015, he was identified by the Swedish press yet again in a Facebook post sent to his brother in Sweden showing him reportedly in Deir ez-Zor, Syria dressed in military fatigues, standing in front of an ISIS flag and holding an AK-47. On 14 March 2015, he uploaded a film clip to his Facebook page showing an execution of a 19 year old Palestinian from Jerusalem. Several people from Malmö, among them Krayem's brother and friends, liked the clip along with individuals in Syria.[15][16][17] In 2018, Belgian investigators found that Krayem was at the scene where 26-year-old Jordanian air force pilot Moaz al Kasasbeh was burned to death by ISIL in January 2015.

Launched in 2012 or 2013, it supplied money, weaponry and training to rebel forces fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war. According to US officials, the program was run by the CIA's Special Activities Division[6] and has trained thousands of rebels.[7] President Barack Obama secretly authorized the CIA to begin arming Syria's embattled rebels in 2013.[8] The program became public knowledge in mid-2016.
>
>One consequence of the program has been a flood of US weapons including assault rifles, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades into the Middle East's black market. Critics saw it as ineffective and expensive, and raised concerns about diversion of weapons to jihadist groups and about Timber Sycamore-backed rebels fighting alongside the al-Nusra Front.[9]

>Martin Bryant was monitored, directed, and, in all likelihood, programmed by Tavistock networks in Tasmania, from at least the time that one of Tavistock' s senior representatives in Australia, the now 88-year-old Dr. Eric Cunningham Dax, first examined Bryant in 1983-84, and set the parameters for all his future "treatment." Dax was for decades an associate of Tavistock's longtime leader and World Federation of Mental Health chairman, Dr. John Rawlings Rees. Beginning with his collaboration with Rees in the late 1930s, Dax, by his own account, had specialized in "brainwashing."\
>[...]\
>Dr. Ian Sale, psychiatrist for the prosecution, recalled in a discussion on April 16: “When he was about 16 or 17, he was examined by a government doctor for the purpose of a pension assessment. It was to that doctor that he made some reference to having a wish to shoot people. She still remembers that to this day.

3. [Eric Cunningham Dax - Career](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Cunningham_Dax#Career)
>In England during the 1930s and 1940s, Dax worked with John Rawlings Rees, Francis Reitmann and other biological psychiatrists who advocated the use of somatic (physical) treatments for patients with mental problems. He contributed to the development of chemical shock,[1] electroconvulsive therapy,[2] and lobotomy[3] while working at Netherne Hospital, Coulsdon, and continued to use lobotomy in Australia.[4]
>
>"Modified leucotomy was introduced into Victoria by Dr. Cunningham Dax .. By the end of 1959, 300 patients had had leucotomies.. but in the years immediately following [this] was reduced to a mere trickle, 23 in 1960, 6 in 1961. .. [even by the dubious scientific standards of self assessment by the people doing this treatment] 1955 was a 'bad' year with 38% failures, and 1958 .. was even less favourable with 45% failures." Overall 32% were rated "no improvement or had deteriorated further", [a typical psychiatric tactic to include two categories for "marked" and "moderate" improvement and just one for the rest, which included deaths]. Only 1% died immediately as a result of the operation but a total of 31 people, 10%, were dead from various causes when their cases were reviewed. [5]
>
>Between 1946 and 1951—when Dax was the Medical Superintendent of Netherne Hospital—he and Reitmann, continuing the 1930s research into art and psychosis at the Maudsley Hospital, pioneered the use of art as part of mainstream psychiatric treatment. Their interest was to research using art both for treatment and for assisting the diagnosis of mental disorder. Dax employed the artist Edward Adamson to facilitate a research art studio at Netherne, and 689 of the people compelled to live at Netherne painted with Adamson in this period, according to Robertson.[6] Dax published his findings in 1953 in his "Experimental Studies in Psychiatric Art".[7] He began a collection of artworks produced by psychiatric patients, taking about 20 objects from Netherne when he went to Melbourne, including paintings from the research art studio and tapestries made in occupational therapy.[8] The Cunningham Dax Collection became one of the largest collections of its type in the world. The Collection can be viewed at the Dax Centre, located in Parkville, Victoria. The Centre runs public education programs and seeks to promote mental health and wellbeing by fostering a greater understanding of the mind, mental illness and trauma through art and creativity.[9]
>
>Adamson carried on the studio for 35 years, and is one of the pioneers of Art Therapy in Britain,[10] and founded the Adamson Collection, now comprising approximately 6000 paintings, drawings, sculptures and ceramics created at Netherne, and currently almost all re-located to the Wellcome Library in anticipation of a securer future in several international institutions.

4. [Mental Hygiene Authority of Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Cunningham_Dax#Mental_Hygiene_Authority_of_Victoria)
>Dax emigrated to Melbourne, Australia at the end of 1951 to take up an appointment in the new year as founding Chairman of the Mental Hygiene Authority of Victoria (later known as the Mental Health Authority), at a salary of £3,200 a year.[11][12] The Authority was formed as a response to public concern about the treatment and welfare of psychiatric patients, [13] and particularly as a response to the Kennedy Report of 1950 which highlighted the plight of these patients in Victoria in the immediate post war era.[14] Dax remained in this position until 1968, introducing major reforms of mental health services.[15] These included the moving of psychiatric treatment from asylums to community settings[16] and the introduction of art programs for patients. In 1961, the World Federation for Mental Health sponsored the publication of Dax's book Asylum To Community,[17] which describes the rapid expansion of community psychiatric centres in Australia. In his introduction to this book the Federation's chairman, John Rawlings Rees, praised Dax's Mental Hygiene Authority as 'a major training ground in psychiatry and mental health work for all the English-speaking populations of the South-western Pacific region'. However, abuse of psychiatric patients was still occurring at such institutions as Newhaven Hospital.[18]
>
>As part of his general strategy to expand psychiatric services, the teaching of psychiatry and the education of doctors in psychiatric principles, Dax lobbied for the creation of a chair of Psychiatry at the University of Melbourne; this was achieved in 1963. He supported the establishment of the Parkville Psychiatric Unit as a teaching unit of the University.[19]
>
>Although health services in Australia were funded and administered at state level, Dax advocated federal intervention to co-ordinate and further resource psychiatric services.[20]

>Following his degree, Rees worked at the Victoria Park Chest Hospital, studying tuberculosis. Rees was finishing his medical education at the London Hospital when World War I began. He joined the Friends Ambulance Unit in 1914, and later became a Medical Officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps, where he was honoured Chevalier de l’ordre de la couronne belge for his work with Belgian civilians.[1] After being invalided back to London for a time, Rees was placed in charge of a motor ambulance unit in Mesopotamia until 1919, when he demobilised with the rank of Captain.[2]

5. [John Rawlings Rees - Inter-War Work at the Tavistock Clinic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawlings_Rees#Inter-War_Work_at_the_Tavistock_Clinic)
>Hugh Crichton-Miller invited Rees to work with him at a private psychiatric nursing home, Bowden House, Harrow on the Hill. Rees married Mary Isobel Hemingway (10 September 1887 – 4 October 1954), the resident medical officer at Bowden House, in 1921. Their marriage occurred shortly after Rees and Crichton-Miller created the Tavistock Square Clinic for Functional Nervous Disorders, a voluntary hospital which opened in 1920.[2] Mary also joined the staff of the Tavistock Clinic. The clinic specialised in the new 'dynamic psychologies' of Sigmund Freud and his followers, and in particular the Object relations theory of Ronald Fairbairn and others. As well as educating others at the clinic, Rees took the DPH in 1920 and MRCP in 1936. Rees was one of the key figures at the original Tavistock Clinic and became its medical director from 1933. He began to make plans to establish an Institute of Medical Psychology, with beds and more opportunities to train people in psychiatric methods, and bought a site in Bloomsbury to build it, but his plans were halted by the outbreak of World War II.[1]

>J.R. Rees was appointed consulting psychiatrist to the British Army during the Second World War, and obtained the rank of brigadier. According to Eric Trist, another key member of the original Tavistock group:
>
>>In 1941 a group of psychiatrists at the Tavistock Clinic saw that the right questions were asked in Parliament to secure the means to try new measures. As a result they were asked to join the Directorate of Army Psychiatry, and did so as a group.[3]

>The work which occupied most of Rees time during the war was the case of Rudolf Hess. Together with Henry Dicks, a fellow member of the Tavistock Clinic group, Rees was charged with the care of Hitler's Deputy at the secret prison locations where he was held following his capture after landing in Scotland.[5] Over the four-year period from June 1941 to Hess' appearance at the Nuremberg trial, Rees apparently established a relationship with Hess: Hess' diaries record many meetings with Rees, referred to at this time as Colonel Rees, in which Hess accused his captors of attempting to poison, drug, and 'mesmerise' him.[6] In 1945 Rees was a member of the three-man British panel (with Churchill's personal physician Lord Moran, and eminent neurologist Dr George Riddoch) which assessed

>After the war, the Tavistock Clinic underwent considerable changes, in which Rees played a key role. He was a member of a group who referred to themselves as the ‘invisible college’, in reference to the 17th century precursor to the Royal Society.[8] This group orchestrated "Operation Phoenix", making plans for Tavistock to rise from the ashes of war. After the war, this group, including Rees and five others, formed the Interim Planning Committee of the Tavistock Clinic. This committee was chaired by Wilfred Bion, meeting twice a week to formulate a new way forward for their work at Tavistock, based on war-time experience.[3] Rees’ plans for the Institute of Medical Psychology were never realised; instead, the group went on to found the Tavistock Institute, with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. Rees left shortly afterwards in 1947.

>On October 8, a battle between Chechen government rebels and the Russian Army occurred in the Mikenskaya area. After the battle had ceased, people came out of their hiding places, and Ibragimov first approached a group of people sitting on a bench, and after a little chat with them he took out a Kalashnikov rifle and shot four of them. Ibragimov, who was reportedly drunk, then went through the village and shot those whom he recognized as being Russians, while sparing those who were Chechens. After taking a bicycle from one of his victims, he methodically rode to houses occupied by Russians, called out their inhabitants, and shot them.[1][2] Whenever he wounded his victims, he would kill them by shooting them again in the head.[3] The victims were left lying in the streets, in yards, and in their homes. In less than an hour, Ibragimov had killed at least 34 Russian inhabitants of the village, aged from 10 to 89 years. He fled when he ran out of ammunition, though two days later, he was captured by Chechen rebels and handed over to the village elders. Without going through a trial, he was handcuffed to a pole at the village square, where he was beaten to death with iron rods by two Russian brothers whose parents he had killed. Ibragimov's corpse was then left lying in the street since the local mullahs forbade to bury him.[4][5][6]

During the privatization after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 90s, he acquired some farm machinery and worked as a driver, later on running a small shop, and at one point was also the local postman.[7] Ibragimov had a brother who was killed in the First Chechen War, and at the time of the killings he was living in Chernokozovo.[8] In August 1999, the Second Chechen War began, and on October 1 the Russian Federation invaded Chechnya as part of the conflict.
>
>The reason for the shooting apparently was the villagers' refusal to dig trenches, and actions of the Russian forces.[9] Ibragimov, according to one villager, stated that "Russians are killing Chechens, so now I am going to kill Russians."[10] Various higher death tolls have been reported, ranging from 35 (34 Russians and a Meskhetian Turk), and 39, to up to 41, and it was also reported that he had shot 42 Russians and five Chechens.[8][11][12][10]

>Ibragimov reportedly had already killed several members of a family named Allenov in another village called Alpatovo a few days prior, though this claim may be erroneously referring to a previous massacre committed by Chechen militants in that same village.

Cho's father was self-employed as a bookstore owner, but made minimal profits from the venture. Seeking better education and opportunities for his three children,[20][21] Cho's father immigrated to the United States with his family in 1992, when Cho was eight years old. The family lived in Detroit, then moved to the Washington metropolitan area after learning that it had one of the largest South Korean expatriate communities in the U.S. Cho's family settled in Centreville, an unincorporated community in western Fairfax County, Virginia, west of Washington, D.C.[22] Cho's father and mother opened a dry-cleaning business. After they moved to Centreville, Cho and his family became permanent residents of the United States as South Korean nationals.[23][24] His parents became members of a local Christian church, and Cho himself was raised as a member of the religion,[25] although in a note Cho "railed against his parents' strong Christian faith."[26]

He was excused from oral presentations and class conversation and received speech therapy.[33] He continued receiving mental health therapy as well until the end of his junior year.[18]

6. [Seung-Hui Cho - Court-ordered psychiatric assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seung-Hui_Cho#Court-ordered_psychiatric_assessment)
>On December 13, 2005, Cho was taken by police to the psychiatric hospital of New River Valley Community Services Board. There, Crouse, the physician who examined Cho the same day, declared Cho was found "mentally ill and in need of hospitalization." He noted that Cho had a flat affect and depressed mood, and that Cho "denies suicidal ideation" and "does not acknowledge symptoms of a thought disorder." The physician also noted: "His insight and judgment are normal." Cho, suspected of being "an imminent danger to himself or others", was detained temporarily at Carilion St. Albans Behavioral Health Center in Radford, Virginia, pending a commitment hearing before the Montgomery County, Virginia district court.[57][71][70] On December 14, 2005, Cho was released from the mental health facility; after Cho's release, on the same day Virginia Special Justice Paul Barnett certified in an order that Cho "presented an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness," and ordered treatment for Cho as an outpatient.[72][70][57][73] However, Cho did not receive the treatment which had been ordered, as due to Virginia's health system "[n]either the court, the university nor community services officials followed up on the judge's order".[70]
>
>Virginia state law on mental health disqualifications to firearms purchases, however, is worded slightly differently from the federal statute. So the form that Virginia courts use to notify state police about a mental health disqualification addresses only the state criteria, which list two potential categories that would warrant notification to the state police: someone who was "involuntarily committed" or ruled mentally "incapacitated".[74]
>
>Because Cho was not involuntarily committed to a mental health facility as an inpatient, he was still legally eligible to buy guns under Virginia law.[74] However, according to Virginia law, "[a] magistrate has the authority to issue a detention order upon a finding that a person is mentally ill and in need of hospitalization or treatment." The magistrate also must find that the person is an imminent danger to himself or others.[57][75] Virginia officials and other law experts have argued that, under United States federal law, Barnett's order meant that Cho had been "adjudicated as a mental defective" and was thus ineligible to purchase firearms under federal law; and that the state of Virginia erred in not enforcing the requirements of the federal law.[74]

6. [Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting - Developmental and mental health problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting#Developmental_and_mental_health_problems)
>Lanza exhibited developmental challenges before the age of three. These included communication and sensory difficulties, socialization delays, and repetitive behaviors. He was seen by the New Hampshire Birth to Three intervention program and referred to special education preschool services.[163] Once at elementary school, he was diagnosed with a sensory-integration disorder. Sensory-processing disorder does not have official status by the medical community as a formal diagnosis but is a common characteristic of autism.[164] His anxiety affected his ability to attend school and in 8th grade he was placed on "homebound" status, which is reserved for children who are too disabled, even with supports and accommodations, to attend school.[165]
>
>When he was 13, Lanza was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome by a psychiatrist, Paul Fox.[156] When he was 14, his parents took him to Yale University's Child Study Center, where he was also diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). He frequently washed his hands and changed his socks 20 times a day, to the point where his mother did three loads of laundry a day.[166] He also sometimes went through a box of tissues in a day because he could not touch a doorknob with his bare hand.[167]
>
>Lanza was treated by Robert King, who recommended extensive support be put in place and prescribed the antidepressant Celexa. He took the medication for three days. His mother Nancy reported: "On the third morning he complained of dizziness. By that afternoon he was disoriented, his speech was disjointed, he couldn't even figure out how to open his cereal box. He was sweating profusely ... it was actually dripping off his hands. He said he couldn't think ... He was practically vegetative."[156] He never took the medication again.[168] A report from the Office of the Child Advocate found that "Yale's recommendations for extensive special education supports, ongoing expert consultation, and rigorous therapeutic supports embedded into (Lanza's) daily life went largely unheeded."[163]
>
>In a 2013 interview, Peter Lanza said he suspected his son might have also had undiagnosed schizophrenia in addition to his other conditions. Lanza said that family members might have missed signs of the onset of schizophrenia and psychotic behavior during his son's adolescence because they mistakenly attributed his odd behavior and increasing isolation to Asperger syndrome.[156][162][169][170][171] Because of concerns that published accounts of Lanza's autism could result in a backlash against others with the condition, autism advocates campaigned to clarify that autism is a brain-related developmental disorder rather than a mental illness.[172] The violence Lanza demonstrated in the shooting is generally not seen in the autistic population[173] and none of the psychiatrists he saw detected troubling signs of violence in his disposition.[156]
>
>Lanza appears to have had no contact with mental health providers after 2006. The report from the Office of the Child Advocate stated: "In the course of Lanza's entire life, minimal mental health evaluation and treatment (in relation to his apparent need) was obtained. Of the couple of providers that saw him, only one—the Yale Child Study Center—seemed to appreciate the gravity of (his) presentation, his need for extensive mental health and special education supports, and the critical need for medication to ease his obsessive-compulsive symptoms."[165]

>After graduating, Kelley enlisted in the United States Air Force (USAF). He served in logistics readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2009 until 2014. He married in April 2011.[39][40] In October 2012, he was charged with assaulting his wife and fracturing his toddler stepson's skull. In response, Kelley made death threats against the superior officers who charged him, and he was caught sneaking firearms onto Holloman Air Force Base.[41] Around that same time, he made threats of self-harm to a coworker.[37] He was then admitted to Peak Behavioral Health Services, a mental health facility in Santa Teresa, New Mexico.[41]
>
In June 2012, Kelley escaped from Peak Behavioral Health Services but was soon apprehended ten miles away at a bus terminal in El Paso, Texas.[41][42] The facility's director of military affairs later recalled that Kelley had stayed at the facility for several weeks, until he was brought to court-martial. While there, he had expressed a desire for "some kind of retribution to his chain of command" and was discovered to have used computers to order "weapons and tactical gear to a P.O. box in San Antonio".[42]
>
>Kelley and his wife divorced in October 2012.[39] In an interview with Inside Edition, his ex-wife said she lived in constant fear of him, as their marriage was filled with abuse. He once threatened her at gunpoint over a speeding ticket, and later threatened to kill her and her entire family.[43]
>
>Kelley was brought before a general court-martial on four charges: assault on his wife, aggravated assault on his stepson, two charges of pointing a loaded gun at his wife, and two counts of threatening his wife with an unloaded gun. In November 2012, Kelley pleaded guilty to two counts of Article 128 UCMJ, for the assault of his wife and stepson. In return, the weapons charges were dropped.[44][45][46] He was sentenced to 12 months of confinement and a reduction in rank to Airman Basic. He appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, but was unsuccessful.[47] In 2014, he was dismissed from the Air Force with a bad conduct discharge.[48][49]

2. [Sutherland Springs church shooting - Ability to purchase and carry firearms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland_Springs_church_shooting#Ability_to_purchase_and_carry_firearms)
>Kelley's general court-martial guilty plea should have made it illegal for him to own, buy, or possess a firearm or ammunition. The conviction should have been flagged by NICS and prevented the purchase.[66][69] Federal law prohibits those convicted of domestic violence–even if it is only a misdemeanor–from possessing firearms.[70][71]
>
>However, the Air Force failed to relay the court-martial convictions to the FBI. In a statement admitting the oversight, the Air Force said, "Initial information indicates that Kelley's domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database by the Holloman Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations."[5][72] One day after the shooting, the Air Force said it had "launched a review of how the service handled the criminal records of former Airman Devin P. Kelley following his 2012 domestic violence conviction".[5][71] Three days after the shooting, Vice President Mike Pence visited the crime scene, and said, "We will find why this information was not properly recorded in 2012, and we will work with leaders in Congress to ensure that this never happens again."[73]

Ati declined the offer, but Komakech repeatedly insisted she dance with him to the point he became aggressive and had to be separated from her. Komakech began rioting and was expelled from the festivities. The drunken private then went to fetch a semi-automatic rifle and returned to the party about ten minutes later. Komakech first killed Irene Ati, and then started shooting randomly at the guests, in which 14 people died on the spot (including Irene Ati) and 12 more later died in hospital, while 13 others were seriously wounded.

Although officers who apprehended Komakech tried to prevent the guests from killing him, Irene Ati's father managed to break through the police cordon and killed Komakech by smashing in his skull.

That same month, Hennard's seaman papers were suspended after he had a racial argument with another shipmate.[11]\

>In 1990, Hennard called Isaiah (Ike) R. Williams, a port agent for the national maritime union in Wilmington, California, stating that he needed a letter of recommendation in order to regain his papers and rejoin the Merchant Marine. "I don't recall having given him one," Williams claimed. Hennard had learned in mid-February that his attempt to be reinstated had been denied.[20] Several months later, Hennard entered a drug treatment program in Houston.[7][11]

>The leader of the Jihadi terrorist group which on August 17th, 2017 attacked Barcelona's Rambla, Abdelbaki Es Satty, was an informer for the Spanish secret service, the CNI, right up until the attacks in which 15 people were murdered.
>
>According to exclusive information published by the Spanish digital newspaper Público.es, Spain's CNI knew that a terrorist group based in the Catalan town of Ripoll was preparing an attack. The newspaper has had access to information that confirms this relationship between the Spanish intelligence agency and the attack mastermind, as well as showing that the CNI spies were monitoring the group's movements to and from the location of their bomb factory.
>
>The intelligence agency communicated with Satty, the imam of Ripoll, through a hard-to-detect communication system known as "dead mail drops", which consists of writing draft emails without sending them. The two people who want to communicate enter the same mailbox and add to their drafts, but since they never hit 'send', the data does not circulate on the internet. As Público.es notes, this system was invented by Bin Laden.
>
>The newspaper has obtained screenshots from the gmail account that was used for communications between the imam and the CNI: adamperez27177@gmail.com. The new revelations are the result of a year of investigation during which the newspaper has opened up intelligence sources, gathered confidential documents and extracted data from the investigations into the attacks.
>
>The email address adamperez27177@gmail.com was active until at least two months before the 2017 terror attack. The last message left in the dead mail was from June 19th, 2017, when the bombs used for the attack were already being manufactured. The passwords to access this email address were found in the remains of the group's bomb factory in the town of Alcanar, whose accidental explosion on August 16th, 2017 killed Satty and one other terror group member. As a result of the explosion, the cell moved quickly and the next day improvised the horrific Rambla van attack and a second deadly attack in the town of Cambrils, instead of the high-powered bomb explosion they had been working towards, possibly aimed at Barcelona's Sagrada Família.
>
>Confidential CNI reports that the newspaper has obtained demonstrate that the Ripoll terror cell was monitored by Spanish intelligence. These documents show that the Spanish agency listened to their conversations and followed their movements. The CNI was aware of the trips made by the members of the Jihadi group from Ripoll to Alcanar and knew about the existence of the villa where explosives were being manufactured.
>
>Moreover, Público affirms that the Spanish secret services monitored the terrorists until the very day of the attacks and that Satty's name was erased from CNI files after the attacks.
>
>The intelligence reports that the newspaper has obtained on the attacks specify in detail the trips that the members of the terror cell made several months before the August 2017 attacks. The Spanish secret service document list separate journeys by terror group members to Switzerland and Germany, and to France and Belgium, all in December 2016. This second trip was made using the same Audi A-3 car that was later used in the Cambrils attack.
>
>The CNI, according to the newspaper, monitored the movements across four countries of the three young men who made the explosives in Alcanar, not only observing their itineraries, but also with advance knowledge of their plans, through listening to their conversations.

2. [Timber Sycamore - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_Sycamore)
>Timber Sycamore was a classified weapons supply and training program run by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and supported by some Arab intelligence services, including Saudi intelligence. Launched in 2012 or 2013, it supplied money, weaponry and training to rebel forces fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war. According to US officials, the program was run by the CIA's Special Activities Division[6] and has trained thousands of rebels.[7] President Barack Obama secretly authorized the CIA to begin arming Syria's embattled rebels in 2013.[8] The program became public knowledge in mid-2016.
>
>One consequence of the program has been a flood of US weapons including assault rifles, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades into the Middle East's black market. Critics saw it as ineffective and expensive, and raised concerns about diversion of weapons to jihadist groups and about Timber Sycamore-backed rebels fighting alongside the al-Nusra Front.[9]

>[...]\
>The inquiry heard that a UK counter-terror investigation into a woman associated with the February 17th Martyrs Brigade had - in January 2017 - seized an image of a person brandishing a rifle in Libya that bears a "strong resemblance" to Salman Abedi, but the likeness was only established in 2018.

4. [How Manchester bomber Salman Abedi was radicalised by his links to Libya](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/28/salman-abedi-manchester-arena-bomber-radicalisation)
>The 22-year-old was influenced in part by the people who formed the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, a little-known al-Qaida affiliate outlawed in 2004[.]\
>[...]\
>Formed in the early 1990s to fight the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the LIFG relocated to Libya where, in 1996, the US treasury department records that it attempted to assassinate Muammar Gaddafi “and replace his regime with a hardline Islamic state”.
>
>When that plot – which some claim was backed by MI6 – failed, the LIFG was pursued by Gaddafi’s security forces. A large number fled to the UK, where they were granted asylum on the grounds that as opponents of Gaddafi “our enemy’s enemy is our friend”, and many went to Birmingham and Manchester – home to established Arab communities that had found work in the cities’ engineering industries.\
>[...]\
>The LIFG’s main fundraising vehicle was the UK-based Sanabel charity which had offices and shops in Manchester, Middlesbrough, Birmingham and London. In addition to funnelling money around the globe to al-Qaida interests, it acted as an incubator for jihadis. Among those with important roles in Sanabel were Basheer al-Faqih, suspected of helping orchestrate the 2003 suicide bombings in Casablanca which killed more than 40 people. He was jailed in the UK in 2007 for possessing documents on how to make explosives and set up a terror cell.
>
>Another crucial member was Abu Anas al-Libi, who ran the Afghanistan end of the Sanabel Relief Agency and had a £20m bounty on his head after his alleged involvement in the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya which killed 224 people. Libi was close to a third man, Abd al-Baset Azzouz, a father of four from Manchester. According to the US state department, Baset Azzouz “was sent to Libya in 2011 by al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to build a fighting force there, and mobilised approximately 200 fighters”.
>
>All three men were close allies of another LIFG member who had fled Libya for Manchester and attended Didsbury mosque: Ramadan Abedi, Salman Abedi’s father.
>
>Manchester’s 5,000-strong Libyan community has been left reeling by Abedi’s action, which Quilliam’s Rafiq suggests was the result of layers upon layers of indoctrination that contributed to his radicalisation. “How has he got to this point?” said Rafiq. “By osmosis. Through his father, through his connections, through the mosque, he has been absorbing Salafi ideology and theology.”
>
>LIFG members reject the charge that they are extremists. But they do believe Libya should be run along strict Islamic lines. Ramadan Abedi was one of the many who took this view and returned – in a move that some say was tacitly endorsed by MI6 – to take part in the revolution that toppled Gaddafi. A Libyan who observed the return of the UK exiles was struck by the fact that they appeared unchanged by decades abroad.\
>[...]\
>After his father returned to Libya, Abedi reportedly shuttled back and forth between a bustling Manchester and a traumatised Tripoli. Some reports suggest he was in Libya for the uprising in 2011 and was injured in 2014 in Ajdabiya in eastern Libya while fighting for an Islamist faction. But in neither country did he find a sense of belonging.

>It has now emerged that in 2014 Abedi, his brother Hashem and around 100 other British citizens were evacuated from Tripoli by HMS Enterprise as the security situation in Libya deteriorated.
>
>They were taken to Malta before returning to the UK.\
>[...]\
>Until a month before his rescue, Abedi was being monitored by UK security forces. The review into the Manchester attack found that, based on the information available at the time, the decision to close his case was sound.

>The withdrawal of $475,000 in cash by the man who killed 22 Nova Scotians in April matches the method the RCMP uses to send money to confidential informants and agents, sources say.
>
>Gabriel Wortman, who is responsible for the largest mass killing in Canadian history, withdrew the money from a Brink’s depot in Dartmouth, N.S., on March 30, stashing a carryall filled with hundred-dollar bills in the trunk of his car.
>
>According to a source close to the police investigation the money came from CIBC Intria, a subsidiary of the chartered bank that handles currency transactions.
>
>Sources in both banking and the RCMP say the transaction is consistent with how the RCMP funnels money to its confidential informants and agents, and is not an option available to private banking customers.
>
>The RCMP has repeatedly said that it had no “special relationship” with Wortman. RCMP Supt. Darren Campbell reiterated that statement during an interview with the Toronto Star published online, and in its print newspaper on Sunday, saying: “The gunman had no special relationship with the RCMP whatsoever.” Campbell told the Star: “The investigation has not uncovered any relationship between the gunman and the RCMP outside of an estranged familial relationship and two retired RCMP members.”
>
>According to the Star story: “Campbell said the reason for Wortman’s large cash withdrawal, which he confirmed was hundreds of thousands of dollars, was not fully known, ‘however, there are indications that near the time of the withdrawal the gunman believed that due to the worldwide pandemic, that his financial assets were safer under his control.'”
>
>Campbell declined to be interviewed by Maclean’s on Friday, prior to this story’s publication online, and again on Tuesday.
>
>Court documents show Wortman owned a New Brunswick-registered company called Berkshire-Broman, the legal owner of two of his vehicles (including one of his police replica cars). Whatever the purpose of that company, there is no public evidence that it would have been able to move large quantities of cash. Wortman also ran his own denturist business and there is no reason to believe it also would require him to handle large amounts of cash.
>
>If Wortman was an RCMP informant or agent, it could explain why the force appeared not to take action on complaints about his illegal guns and his assault on his common-law wife.
>
>A Mountie familiar with the techniques used by the force in undercover operations, but not with the details of the investigation into the shooting, says Wortman could not have collected his own money from Brink’s as a private citizen.
>
>“There’s no way a civilian can just make an arrangement like that,” he said in an interview.
>
>He added that Wortman’s transaction is consistent with the Mountie’s experience in how the RCMP pays its assets. “I’ve worked a number of CI cases over the years and that’s how things go. All the payments are made in cash. To me that transaction alone proves he has a secret relationship with the force.”
>
>A second Mountie, who does not know the first one but who has also been involved in CI operations, also believes that Wortman’s ability to withdraw a large sum of money from Brink’s is an indication that Wortman had a link with the police. “That’s tradecraft,” the Mountie said, explaining that by going through CIBC Intria, the RCMP could avoid typical banking scrutiny, as there are no holds placed on the money.
>
>“That’s what we do when we need flash money for a buy. We don’t keep stashes of money around the office. When we suddenly need a large sum of money to make a buy or something, that’s the route we take. I think [with the Brink’s transaction] you’ve proved with that single fact that he had a relationship with the police. He was either a CI or an agent.”
>
>A Canadian retail banking expert speaking on condition that they not be identified says it is unlikely that Wortman was cashing out his own savings when he collected the money from Brinks after the money was transferred from CIBC Intria.
>
>“When you come into my branch and you want a ton of cash, then I say, you gotta give us a couple of days. We put in our Brink’s order, I order the money through Brink’s, then when the money arrives, you come back into the branch, I bring you into a back room and I count the money out for you,” the banking expert said. “Sending someone to Brink’s to get the money? I’ve never heard of that before. The reason is, if I’m the banker, and you’ve deposited your savings in my bank branch, I’m responsible for making sure the money goes to the right person. If you want this money, I’m going to verify your identity and document that. I can’t do that if I’m transferring the money to Brink’s.”
>
>In response to detailed questions from Maclean’s about the transaction, a CIBC spokesperson replied via email: “Our hearts and thoughts are with the families and the entire community as they deal with this senseless tragedy and loss. Unfortunately we are not able to comment on specific client matters.” Brinks did not reply to questions about the transaction.
>
>The banking expert speculates that the RCMP could keep transactions relatively quiet by going through Brink’s instead of a bank to transfer money to a confidential informant or an agent.
>
>“You can imagine that if someone comes in with large sums of cash, that stuff is not kept quiet. You don’t want that. Maybe what the RCMP was doing is they thought they could keep things quieter simply by transferring funds via Brink’s.”
>
>At a press briefing on June 4, the RCMP’s Campbell seemed to rule out the possibility that Wortman was a confidential informant for the force. “The gunman was never associated to the RCMP as a volunteer or auxiliary police officer, nor did the RCMP ever have any special relationship with the gunman of any kind.”
>
>The RCMP Operations Manual, a copy of which was obtained by Maclean’s, authorizes the force to mislead all but the courts in order to conceal the identity of confidential informants and agent sources.
>
>“The identity of a source must be protected at all times except when the administration of justice requires otherwise, i.e. a member cannot mislead a court in any proceeding in order to protect a source.”
>
>A spokeswoman for the Nova Scotia RCMP declined further comment after Maclean’s reported on the financial transaction.
>
>“This is still an active, ongoing investigation,” said Cpl. Jennifer Clarke in an email on Friday. “All investigative avenues and possibilities continue to be explored, analyzed, and processed with due diligence. This is to ensure that the integrity of the investigation is not compromised. We cannot release anything more related to your questions.”
>
>Maclean’s reported earlier this week that sources say Wortman had social relationships with Hells Angels, and with a neighbour, Peter Alan Griffon, who recently finished serving part of a seven-year sentence for drug and firearm offences linked to La Familia, a Mexican cartel. Sources say Griffon printed the decals that Wortman used on the replica RCMP cruiser he used in his rampage.
>
>Sources say that RCMP in New Brunswick, not Nova Scotia, recently took over operational control of investigations into outlaw bikers in the Maritimes, which means that Nova Scotia Mounties may not have been aware of any connection to Wortman.
>
>The RCMP Operations Manual identifies two types of sources: informant sources and agent sources. A law enforcement source said the force uses Brink’s to make large payments to agent sources, not informant sources.
>
>“Informants are never paid more than a couple hundred at a time,” said a person briefed on RCMP operations. “Anything over $10,000 is agent money.”
>
>Agents typically have greater responsibilities than informants. Only officers who have received specialized training are allowed to handle agents.
>
>“An agent source is a person tasked by investigators to assist in the development of target operations,” says the manual. “Direct involvement and association with a target may result in his/her becoming a material and compellable witness, ie. a source used to introduce undercover operations, act as a courier for controlled delivers or act in place of an RCMP undercover operator by obtaining evidence.”
>
>If the money was a transfer from the RCMP to an agent, there would be a paper trail through FINTRAC, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, which tracks large cash transactions and suspicious transactions.
>
>“Brink’s does the FINTRAC paperwork saying it’s coming from us, it’s from a chartered bank, and the RCMP liaison at FINTRAC signs off, handles the paperwork,” said a source briefed on the system. “The RCMP guys clear it or they refer it for further investigation. They manually clear those FINTRAC reports coming from Brink’s related to paid agents.”
>
>The RCMP Operations Manual requires officers handling confidential informants and agents to send reports to the director of the Covert Operations Branch at National Headquarters.
>
>Headquarters’ media relations office said in an email Friday that Campbell’s statement that the force never had a “special relationship” with Wortman “still stands.”
>
>The attorney general of Nova Scotia, former RCMP staff sergeant Mark Furey, has said the province is in talks with Ottawa about a joint federal-provincial inquiry or review of Wortman’s murderous rampage.
>
>Furey’s office did not reply before deadline to a question about whether the terms of the inquiry would allow inquiry counsel to pierce the powerful legal privilege that attaches to confidential informants.
>
>Family members of the victims have complained that the process is dragging out. As calls for an inquiry mount, so does speculation about what happened, among both the general public and the RCMP.
>
>One former Mountie says he doesn’t understand why Wortman would turn against the Mounties if they were paying him. “What seems inconsistent to me is why are you going to bite the hand that feeds you? If he’s getting money, and that’s a lot of money for an agent, or a CI, that part doesn’t make sense to me.”
>
>The former investigator pointed out that if Wortman was acting for the RCMP, and receiving that amount of money, he would eventually be expected to testify.
>
>“If he was an agent, he should show up on a witness docket.”
>
>But another Mountie says, “This guy always wanted to be a Mountie. He was acting like a Mountie. He was doing Mountie things. It’s clear to me that something went wrong.”

>
>As for the replica police car, which the gunman used to escape and later surprise victims, it was obtained in the fall of 2019, and was one of four former police vehicles he bought at auctions in the last few years.
>
>Campbell said the 51-year-old Halifax-based denturist outfitted the vehicle with an emergency light bar and decals that made the late-model Ford Taurus look almost identical to a genuine RCMP vehicle.

>“The gunman was a collector of many things, including police memorabilia,” Campbell told reporters. “He was in possession of multiple pieces of police uniforms from a variety of agencies …. How he obtained the decals and how they were produced is an investigative detail that I can’t get into.”

>Campbell said many witnesses have come forward to confirm the killer had a keen interest in the RCMP.
>
>Used RCMP uniforms can be purchased from surplus stores, auctions and through online vendors, but Campbell said it was unclear how the suspect obtained the uniform in question.

>In early 1965, Huberty married Etna Markland, whom he had met while attending Malone College. Shortly after his marriage, Huberty obtained employment at a funeral home in Canton. Although proficient at embalming, Huberty's introverted personality made him ill-suited to dealing with members of the public, causing minor conflicts with his superiors. Nonetheless, Huberty worked in this profession for two years before opting to become a welder for a firm in Louisville. He worked for this firm for two years before securing a better-paid position at Babcock & Wilcox in June 1969.[69] Although reclusive and taciturn, Huberty's employers considered him a reliable worker. He willingly took overtime, earned promotions and by the mid-1970s, regularly earned between $25,000 and $30,000 per year ($121,000–$145,000, adjusted for 2021 inflation).

>A conspiracy theorist and self-proclaimed survivalist, Huberty believed an escalation of the Cold War was inevitable and that president Jimmy Carter and, later, Ronald Reagan and the United States government were conspiring against him.[75] Convinced of an imminent increase in Soviet aggression, Huberty believed that a breakdown of society was fast approaching, perhaps through economic collapse or nuclear war. He committed himself to prepare to survive this perceived collapse and provisioned his house with ample reserve supplies of non-perishable food and numerous guns—some purchased from co-workers[71]—that he intended to use to defend his home during what he believed was the coming apocalypse.[76] According to one family acquaintance named Jim Aslanes, Huberty's home was bedecked with loaded firearms[77] to such a degree that wherever Huberty was sitting or standing within his home, he "could just reach over and get a gun." Each firearm was loaded, with the safety catch disabled.[71]

Etna successfully dissuaded her husband from shooting himself, although he later remarked to her: "You should have let me shoot myself."[18][n 7]

>In San Ysidro, the Hubertys rented an apartment within the Cottonwood Apartments as Huberty sought employment. The fact his family were the only Anglo-Americans within this apartment complex irritated Huberty, who was notably ignorant to his neighbors.[83] Shortly thereafter, Huberty applied to a newspaper advertisement offering security guard training in a federally funded program. He completed this course on April 12 and soon obtained employment with a security firm in Chula Vista, assigned with guarding a condominium complex.[13] The money earned enabled the family to have their furniture shipped from Ohio, and the family relocated to a two-bedroom apartment on Averil Road the same month.[83] The monthly rent for this apartment was $450.[62]
>
>On July 10, Huberty was summarily dismissed from this job;[3] his employers informed Huberty the reasons for his dismissal were his poor work performance and a noted general physical instability.[66][84]

6. [San Ysidro McDonald's massacre - Aftermath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Ysidro_McDonald%27s_massacre#Aftermath)
>In July 1986, Etna Huberty filed a lawsuit against both McDonald's and her husband's longtime former employer, Babcock & Wilcox.[115] This civil suit—seeking $5 million in damages—asserted her husband's murder spree had been triggered by a combination of a poor diet and her husband working around highly poisonous metals without adequate protection over the course of many years.[115][n 10]
>
>The suit specifically cited that no traces of either drugs or alcohol had been discovered in Huberty's body at his autopsy—negating any possibility of his actions being influenced by either factor[96]—and that the alleged accrual of the high levels of lead and cadmium discovered in Huberty's body at his autopsy had most likely accumulated via an ongoing exposure to the fumes inhaled during the 13 years he had been employed as a welder (without sufficient respiratory protection) by Babcock & Wilcox,[11] and that a combination of Huberty's exposure to these chemicals with his ingesting high levels of monosodium glutamate in the staple McDonald's food he had regularly consumed[115] had induced delusions and an uncontrollable rage. This lawsuit was dismissed in 1987.[116] Etna Huberty died of breast cancer in 2003.[13]

1. [Informant Claude Hermant implicates French state in Charlie Hebdo attacks](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/05/22/herm-m22.html)
>Claude Hermant, a police informant arrested in the case of the January 7, 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris, has implicated the French state in the preparation of the attack. Hermant, who allegedly sold weapons used by Amédy Coulibaly and the Kouachi brothers to commit the attacks, is reportedly charging that three gendarme military policemen and two customs officials, as well as organized crime circles, were involved.
>
>The case shatters the official narrative, according to which terror attacks in France, Belgium, and Germany since 2015 have been the work of isolated Islamists.
>
>Hermant’s lawyer, Maxime Moulin, does not dispute the fact that weapons that passed through the hands of his client, who was acting for the customs’ intelligence agency until 2013 and then worked for the gendarmerie, reached Coulibaly. The media and established political parties covered up this fact, together with Hermant’s arrest after the attacks due to his relations with Coulibaly. The interior minister in 2015, Bernard Cazeneuve, even invoked the states secrets privilege in regard to investigations of the relations between Hermant and the Islamists.
>
>Moulin filed a suit with the state prosecutor’s office in Lille on May 2, accusing the interior minister of endangering his client’s life. He stated, “We are demanding the lifting of the states secrets privilege. Things are being hidden, this was the solution that we found to obtain the truth. … We want to have access to this information. We are officially asking that the Interior Ministry lift the states secrets privilege on all contact reports [between the gendarmerie and Claude Hermant]. We want to know what reports were handled, what information was not transmitted, what reports were ignored, and why.”
>
>Moulin said that Hermant had acted purely in the interests of the customs service and of the gendarmerie: “We cannot accept when the gendarmerie ’s work is really borderline. When things work out, they are happy, but when things don’t, they hang you out to dry in the ruins. They can’t abandon a soldier in the field like this.”
>
>According to the daily Libération, Moulin justified his client’s suit by citing “a Médiapart article of March 2017. Claude Hermant had warned the gendarmerie that a convoy with weapons was passing through the tollbooths on the Lille to Paris highway, but the gendarmerie only succeeded in intercepting half of the vehicles. The second convoy, which had been warned that the gendarmes had been alerted, managed to evade them. And those weapons were used by Coulibaly.”
>
>The Voix du Nord daily published a few extracts of emails exchanged between Hermant and a gendarme in November 2014: “Hey Claude, we talked it over with our superiors. … We’re giving you a green light for the two cases you showed us (weapons—[the city of]Charleroi) ...”
>
>These emails suggest that Hermant may have received official approval from some intelligence agency for his actions in the Coulibaly-Kouachi affair. The Voix du Nord encourages its readers to draw their own conclusions: “Suppose you ran across this type of message (of a dozen or so in total), that a gendarme allegedly sent to Claude Hermant on 20 November 2017 at 8:47 a.m., and that a close friend of the accused insists that ‘Claude Hermant has all his bases covered.’”

>A gunman killed by French police on Friday after taking a number of hostages at a kosher supermarket in Paris met with then-president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2009. According to local newspaper Le Parisien, Sarkozy met with 500 young French people on July 15, 2009 to talk about work/study training and youth employment; among them was Amedy Coulibaly, then 27 and on contract at a Coca-Cola factory in Grigny, a suburb of Paris. Coulibaly was interviewed by the newspaper in advance of the meeting, saying he was excited to meet the president and hoped he could help get him hired when his contract at the factory ended. He said his nine sisters had charged him with getting autographs and photos for the whole family. “In the cities, with the young people, Sarkozy isn’t really very popular,” Coulibaly said. “But it’s nothing personal. In fact, that’s the case with most politicians.” But the president’s unpopularity didn’t curb Coulibaly’s enthusiasm: “Whether you like him or not, he’s still the president.”

http://web.archive.org/web/20201030171821/http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a0696qatada#a0696qatada
>In June and December 1996, and again in February 1997, a British MI5 agent meets with radical Muslim imam Abu Qatada, hoping he will inform on his fellow extremists. Qatada is a Jordanian national who entered Britain in September 1993 using a forged United Arab Emirates passport, and was granted asylum in 1994.
>
>Qatada Promises to Look after British Interests - In his meetings with the MI5 agent he claims to “wield powerful, spiritual influence over the Algerian community in London.” He says he does not want London to become a center for settling Islamic scores, and that he will report anyone damaging British interests. He says the individuals he has influence over pose no threat to British security, and promises that “he would not bite the hand that fed him.” He also promises to “report anyone damaging the interests of [Britain].” The MI5 agent records that “surprisingly enough—[Abu Qatada] revealed little love of the methodology and policies pursued by Osama bin Laden. He certainly left me with the impression that he had nothing but contempt for bin Laden’s distant financing of the jihad.” [SPECIAL IMMIGRATION APPEALS COMMISSION, 1/2004 pdf file; CHANNEL 4 NEWS (LONDON), 3/23/2004; GUARDIAN, 3/24/2004; LONDON TIMES, 3/25/2004]
>
>Links to Al-Qaeda - Yet Qatada is later described as being a “key [British] figure” in al-Qaeda related terror activity. Around 1996, a highly reliable informer told US intelligence that Qatada is on al-Qaeda’s fatwa (religious) committee (see June 1996-1997). Videos of his sermons are later discovered in the Hamburg flat used by Mohamed Atta. Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, and Zacarias Moussaoui, who is later convicted in connection with the 9/11 attacks, are alleged to have sought religious advice from him. [BBC, 8/11/2005; GUARDIAN, 8/11/2005]
>
>Meetings Apparently Continue - Reportedly, after Qatada’s February 1997 meeting with the British agent, no further such meetings occur. [SPECIAL IMMIGRATION APPEALS COMMISSION, 1/2004 pdf file] However, some French officials later allege that Qatada continues to be an MI5 agent, and this is what allows him to avoid arrest after 9/11 (see Early December 2001). [OBSERVER, 2/24/2002] It will later emerge that Bisher al-Rawi, a friend of Qatada, served as an informant and a go-between MI5 and Qatada in numerous meetings between late 2001 and 2002, when Qatada is finally arrested (see Late September 2001-Summer 2002). Furthermore, al-Rawi says he served as a translator between MI5 and Qatada before 9/11, suggesting that Qatada never stopped being an informant. [OBSERVER, 7/29/2007]

>Without telling his father beforehand, Whitman enlisted in the United States Marine Corps one month after his June 1959 graduation from high school, where he had graduated seventh in a class of 72 students.[7] Whitman told a family friend that the catalyst for his enlistment was an incident a month earlier, in which his father had beaten him and thrown him into the family swimming pool because Whitman had come home drunk.[8] Whitman left home on July 6, having been assigned an eighteen-month tour of duty with the Marines at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. As Whitman traveled toward Parris Island, his father, who still had not known of Whitman's enlistment,[7] learned of his action and telephoned a branch of the federal government trying to have his son's enlistment canceled.[12]

After completing his assignment, Whitman applied for a scholarship to the Naval Enlisted Science and Education Program (NESEP), an initiative designed to send enlisted personnel to college to train as engineers, and after graduation, be commissioned as officers.[18][19]

>>"I do not quite understand what it is that compels me to type this letter. Perhaps it is to leave some vague reason for the actions I have recently performed. I do not really understand myself these days. I am supposed to be an average reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately (I cannot recall when it started) I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts. These thoughts constantly recur, and it requires a tremendous mental effort to concentrate on useful and progressive tasks.[43]"
>
>In his note, Whitman went on to request an autopsy be performed on his remains after he was dead to determine if there had been a discernible biological contributory cause for his actions and for his continuing and increasingly intense headaches. He also wrote that he had decided to kill both his mother and wife. Expressing uncertainty about his reasons, he nonetheless stated he did not believe his mother had "ever enjoyed life as she is entitled to",[42] and that his wife had "been as fine a wife to me as any man could ever hope to have". Whitman further explained that he wanted to relieve both his wife and mother of the suffering of this world, and to save them the embarrassment of his actions. He did not mention planning the attack at the university.[44]

>Investigating officers found that Whitman had visited several UT Austin physicians in the year before the shootings; they prescribed various medications for him. Whitman had seen a minimum of five doctors between the fall and winter of 1965 before he visited a psychiatrist from whom he received no prescription. At some other time he was prescribed Valium by Jan Cochrum, who recommended he visit the campus psychiatrist.[54]
>
>Whitman met with Maurice Dean Heatly, the staff psychiatrist at the University of Texas Health Center, on March 29, 1966.[55] He referred to his visit with Heatly in his final suicide note, writing: "I talked with a Doctor once for about two hours and tried to convey to him my fears that I felt come [sic] overwhelming violent impulses. After one visit, I never saw the Doctor again, and since then have been fighting my mental turmoil alone, and seemingly to no avail."[43]
>
>Heatly's notes on the visit said, "This massive, muscular youth seemed to be oozing with hostility [...] that something seemed to be happening to him and that he didn't seem to be himself."[56] "He readily admits having overwhelming periods of hostility with a very minimum of provocation. Repeated inquiries attempting to analyze his exact experiences were not too successful with the exception of his vivid reference to 'thinking about going up on the tower with a deer rifle and start shooting people.'"[57]

>Exclusive: The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry was told by two witnesses that twisted killer Thomas Hamilton was often seen at Queen Victoria School in Dunblane
>
>Evil Dunblane gunman Thomas Hamilton was named by two witnesses in the public inquiry into historic child abuse, the Scottish Express can reveal.
>
>One witness told judge Lady Smith that he saw Hamilton with Queen Victoria School housemaster Ben Philip, who is said to have sexually abused pupils before his unusual death in 1993.
>
>Another witness told the inquiry that he saw the infamous killer on school grounds “all the time” and he would even take boys out on day trips.
>
>However, this remarkable testimony about one of Britain’s most notorious murderers was given little attention by the judge and the lawyers conducting the inquiry.
>
>The first witness, former teacher Glenn Harrison, also gave evidence about an alleged paedophile ring operating at the top military school in Dunblane, near Stirling.
>
>The school for children of Scots servicemen and women has close ties to the Royal Family and has already apologised for the physical and sexual abuse and bullying that occurred in the past.
>
>In his written statement, Mr Harrison told how he challenged a “strange man” walking in a school corridor between 10.30pm and 11pm one night in 1991.
>
>After checking the school visitors’ register the next day, he said: “There were no visitors signed in the previous evening. [Redacted] name wasn’t in these registers because he used to come and use the shooting range. I didn’t know who [redacted] was at the time.”
>
>The Scottish Express understands the redacted name is that of Hamilton, a gun obsessive who would go on to murder 16 Dunblane Primary pupils and their class teacher in 1996.
>
>Mr Harrison said he saw the same man speaking to Philip the following day and then again from a window when he was “with other dignitaries at a passing out parade”.
>
>In 1996, Mr Harrison was working as a teacher in Shetland when he saw Hamilton’s photograph in the newspapers.
>
>He said: “I recognised him in the picture as being the male that I saw in the corridor at Queen Victoria School.”\
>[...]\
>Despite these closing submissions, however, Mr Harrison’s evidence WAS in fact backed up by another witness.
>
>‘Alex’, who was sexually abused by an older pupil, also recalled that boys were taken out of the school by “higher up people” known as “the Friends of QV”.
>
>He said: “Cars would appear and take the boys away. There were always little rumours flying about… There was mention of boys being taken out for drinks and things like that… Looking back now there was something going on that felt kind of not right.”
>
>His written evidence goes on to suggest that Thomas Hamilton was one of the men who took the boys out on “various trips to do different things”.
>
>He said: “One of the people who was around the school a lot was [redacted]… He was in the school all the time.”
>
>Again, it is understood that the redacted name is that of Thomas Hamilton.

>Alex (not his real name) waived his anonymity and spoke about his ordeal at QVS in an interview with the Sunday Post in December 2020.

>Mick Ranger sold the gun used in the Hungerford massacre. Now he is selling missiles, machine guns and rifles almost anywhere in the world[.]
>
>Anybody passing Frog Hall farm in the pretty Essex village of Takeley would not give it a second glance. But an Observer investigation can reveal that the white farmhouse is the headquarters of an international business that sells weapons in some of the most volatile trouble spots in the world.
>
>It is the base of Mick Ranger, an arms dealer who sold Michael Ryan the Chinese-made Kalashnikov AK47 rifle that he used in 1987 to kill 16 people in Hungerford.
>
>Ranger, now 56, has kept a low profile since that massacre. However, he runs a lucrative arms brokerage with operations in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Nigeria, Australia, South Africa and Vietnam.
>
>The website of his firm, Imperial Defence Services, boasts: 'Our business is truly global, with no geographical limitations... with the sole exception of countries under United Nations embargo.
>
>'Apart from countless transactions involving small arms, we have completed transactions for surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank weapons, missile warhead fuses, grenades and heavy machine guns.'
>
>Ranger's website claims he sells grenade-launchers for £450 and a collection of rifles from £195 to a £20,000 General Electric mini-gun.
>
>A reporter claiming he acted for a security company on the Iraqi border in Syria asked Ranger last February whether he could supply AK47s and land mines to protect an oilfield. The reporter made it clear the weapons might be used in Iraq.
>
>Despite the sensitivity of the Middle East situation at the time, Ranger confirmed in writing that he was happy to supply 200 rifles at $275 (£173) each through his Bulgarian office, but not the mines as the 'penalties are very high'. and he would not agree to any deal where Iraq was mentioned in official documents.
>
>Ranger wrote: 'There was actually very recently a scandle [sic] in Bulgaria where kit destined for Syria was in fact found to be going to Iraq, so the Bulgaria [sic] government will require very conclusive wording on the EUC [end-user certificate] that the guns being supplied will stay in Syria and will only be used by people so authorised by the Syrian government.'
>
>Asked later in a phone call about getting an Iraqi import licence, he replied: 'I don't want to know anything about Iraq. I told you before, do not mention the word Iraq to me. There's a 25-year jail sentence for me. The UN embargo on Iraq is clear. Go and read it on the web.'
>
>Ranger told The Observer from Bulgaria last week that he believed this deal was for a peacekeeping operation in Syria which had British government approval. He stressed that he always acted within the law and would never breach UN sanctions.
>
>The Observer has also uncovered his involvement in a potential arms deal in Cambodia, which is still awash with guns after the civil war that ended five years ago. Last July Ranger approached the Cambodian authorities trying to buy 150,000 surplus rifle magazines. He offered to exchange them for Land Rovers. The Cambodian government refused to sanction the deal unless it was approved by the European Union.
>
>The EU, which has set up an office in the capital, Phnom Penh, to help the government control the spread of small arms, refused to approve the deal. It believed that such a transaction would involve Cambodia in international arms trading.
>
>According to an EU source, Ranger was so furious about the decision that he stormed out of talks with officials.
>
>The arms broker insists he was operating with the 'blessing of British officials' in Phnom Penh and that he had all the correct export licences. Ranger said he had a client who was interested in buying the rifle magazines, but refused to reveal who this was.
>
>There is no suggestion that Ranger has acted illegally in any of his arms deals. Indeed, that is what concerns human rights groups such as Oxfam and Saferworld. They are alarmed that British arms brokers can wander the globe trading weapons without proper scrutiny from the British authorities. They claim that Labour has broken an election pledge to clamp down on such deals.
>
>Paul Eavis, director of Saferworld, called on the Government to stop British-based brokers like Ranger 'getting round the law by operating from overseas'.
>
>The Government is consulting on changes to the Export Control Act, which includes proposals to control the activities of UK arms brokers by requiring them to be issued with a new 'control order' for each overseas deal. However, campaign groups believe these still leave open significant loopholes.
>
>An order will be needed when any part of a transaction takes place in the UK. The Government has not, however, said exactly what this will mean in practice.
>
>It is unclear whether the orders would cover deals such as the one in which Ranger was willing to sell arms to Syria through his Bulgarian company.
>
>The broker insists he sells only to companies or governments which have proper authority, and that he obeys the law and the UN.
>
>'If end-user statements are correct and authenticated by exporting governments, as one would hope they would, then it is a totally legitimate transaction... And that's the only kind of business I'm involved in,' Ranger said. Asked if he was concerned that the equipment he sells might be used for unsavoury purposes, he replied: 'It is true I unwittingly supplied the gun Michael Ryan used. But I didn't supply the licence for him to have it. That was the police. It is always somebody beyond me that makes the decision.'
>
>Ranger's website says his company is 'licensed [by the UK Government] to deal in military weapons of all types and to manufacture pistols and fully automatic weapons.
>
>'All currently required UK licences are held by this company in connection with arms dealing... [including] an open international import licence that allows us to import into the UK without further reference to government agencies an unlimited quantity of small arms and ammunition of conventional types, and an open licence for large quantities of automatic weapons.'
>
>Brendan Cox, an Oxfam spokesman, said: 'Arms brokers are still operating with near impunity and making massive profits at the expense of the 500,000 people killed every year by firearms. It's time the Government made good its promises to crack down on this deadly trade.'

>Ronald Gene Simmons was born on July 15, 1940, in Chicago, Illinois, to Loretta and William Simmons. On January 31, 1943, William Simmons died of a stroke and within a year, Simmons's mother had remarried, this time to William D. Griffen, a civil engineer for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In 1946, the corps moved Griffen to Little Rock, Arkansas, the first of several transfers that would take the family across central Arkansas over the next decade.[2]
>
>On September 15, 1957, Simmons dropped out of school and joined the U.S. Navy, and was first stationed at Naval Station Bremerton in Washington, where he met Bersabe Rebecca "Becky" Ulibarri, whom he married in New Mexico on July 9, 1960. Over the next 18 years, the couple had seven children. In 1963, Simmons left the navy, and approximately two years later joined the U.S. Air Force. During his 20-year military career, Simmons was awarded a Bronze Star Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross for his service as an airman, and the Airforce Ribbon for Excellent Marksmanship. Simmons retired from the air force and military service on November 30, 1979, with the rank of master sergeant.
>
>On April 3, 1981, Simmons was being investigated by the Cloudcroft, New Mexico Department of Human Services for allegations that he had fathered a child with his 17-year-old daughter, Sheila, whom he had been sexually abusing.[1] Fearing arrest, Simmons fled New Mexico in late 1981 with his family, first to Ward, Arkansas, in Lonoke County, and then to Pope County near Dover, Arkansas in the summer of 1983. The family took up residence on a 13-acre tract of land 6.5 miles north of Dover that would become known as Mockingbird Hill. The residence was constructed of two older-model mobile homes joined to form one large home, neither of which had a telephone nor indoor plumbing, and was surrounded by a makeshift privacy fence which was as high as 10-feet tall in some places.[1]
>
>Simmons worked a string of low-paying jobs in the nearby town of Russellville, Arkansas. He quit a position as an accounts receivable clerk at Woodline Motor Freight after numerous reports of inappropriate sexual advances and went to work at a Sinclair Mini Mart for approximately a year and a half before quitting on December 18, 1987.

>Éric Borel was the son of Marie-Jeanne Parenti and Jacques Borel, who were both working in the military at the time of his birth. However, their liaison was rather short, and after they separated, Borel was sent to Jacques' parents in Limoges, where he stayed until he was five. When his mother, who had visited Borel only occasionally up to that time, began to live with Yves Bichet, she again took care of her son and brought him to their home in Solliès-Pont.[3][4]
>
>Borel's mother was an authoritarian and – at least outwardly – a devoutly religious member of the Secours catholique.[5] She mistreated and beat her son, who she believed to be a "child of sin". Borel never developed a close relationship with his mother's new companion, with whom he was said to have frequent rows and who reportedly also beat him on occasions.[6] However, Franck and Jean-Luc Bichet, Yves Bichet's sons, stated that their father had always been nice to Borel, even building him a shack for his chickens and other animals he took home.[4]
>
>When Borel broke his arm at the age of eight, he preferred to run away and hide rather than go home; he was eventually found shivering from pain. In this type of situation, Borel, who was known as a quiet and taciturn boy who kept to himself, grew up and developed an increasing admiration for the military. He told lies about the heroic deeds of his father during the Indochina War and adored his stepbrother Franck Bichet, who served in the army. He had an affection for weapons and used to shoot sparrows with an air gun.[4]

>Until his death, Borel attended the lycée professionnel Georges-Cisson in Toulon, where he studied electromechanics and did well academically. He was said to be a disciplined and quiet student. However, in his last year at school, there was a radical change in Borel's behavior. He skipped classes without explanation and became unaffable. He also regularly said that he could not bear it anymore at home, that he had had enough of doing housework and being called names, and often stated his wish to join the military like his father and grandfather. Apparently, the week prior to the shooting, Borel also told one of his classmates that he would kill himself, but not before killing two or three people.[3][6] Borel's only known friend at school was 17-year-old Alan Guillemette, an outgoing and popular classmate.[6]

>Harris began keeping a journal in April 1998, a short time after the pair was convicted of breaking into a van, for which each received ten months of juvenile intervention counseling and community service in January 1998. They began to formulate plans then, as reflected in their journals.[97]
>
>Harris wanted to join the United States Marine Corps, but his application was rejected shortly before the shootings because he was taking the drug fluvoxamine, an SSRI antidepressant, which he was required to take as part of court-ordered anger management therapy. Harris did not state in his application that he was taking any medications. According to the recruiting officer, Harris did not know about this rejection. Though some friends of Harris suggested that he had stopped taking the drug beforehand,[111] the autopsy reports showed low therapeutic or normal (not toxic or lethal) blood-levels of fluvoxamine in his system, which was around 0.0031–0.0087 mg/ml,[112] at the time of death.[113] After the shootings, opponents of contemporary psychiatry like Peter Breggin[114] claimed that the psychiatric medications prescribed to Harris after his conviction may have exacerbated his aggressiveness.[115]

>Eric David Harris was born on April 9, 1981, in Wichita, Kan., where his dad was working at the Boeing Military Airplane Co. Wayne Harris already was an officer and a heavily decorated pilot lauded for a cool hand during airborne refueling missions.
>
In 1983, Wayne and Kathy and their sons, Kevin, then 5, and Eric, moved to Beavercreek, Ohio, where Harris flew for the 4952nd Test Squadron at Wright Air Force Base.
>
>Eric attended first and second grade at Valley Elementary School in Beavercreek and his father continued collecting medals. Harris' flying "skill and leadership" helped in the testing of strategic missile and space systems, Air Force records show. He earned the meritorious service medal, four oak leaf clusters, two bronze service stars and an award for small arms marksmanship.
>
>His youngest boy would aspire to be a military man too, but would also develop a twisted love for combat gore and battlefield violence.
>
>In 1989, Wayne Harris, still flying KC-135 refueling tankers, was transferred to the Wurtsmith Air Force base in Oscoda, Mich., a small city near the shore of Lake Huron. Instead of living on base, he bought a two-story, Cape Cod-style home in a comfortable subdivision next to Cedar Lake.
>
>"I just remember they wanted the children to have a normal, off-base relationship in a normal community," says the Rev. Bill Stone, a pastor who lived across the street. "They were just great neighbors - friendly, outgoing, caring."
>
>Wayne Harris, a Scoutmaster and baseball coach, got elected to the nine-member Lake Shores Property Owners Association. Kathy Harris was a stay-at-home mom. The family lived on a wooded lot on a street where deer often graze in the flower gardens and kids splash around at the neighborhood beach club. After work, Wayne Harris shot baskets with his two boys. Eric Harris attended third and fourth grades at Cedar Lake Elementary School. But their stay ended when Wurtsmith was shut down at the end of 1991 and Wayne Harris was transferred to the air base in Plattsburgh, N.Y.
>
>He served two years with the 380th Operations Support Squadron at the upstate base. While there, Eric Harris attended Stafford Middle School for fifth and sixth grades. As a kid from the base, his friends were a diverse bunch and included some of the same minorities he allegedly would target as a teenager.
>
>"His best friends on the base were ... an Asian and ... a black kid," said 18-year-old Mike Condo, who played Little League baseball with Harris and joined him on a whale-watching trip to Boston around 1993.
>
>Harris is remembered in Plattsburgh as a "normal" 12-year-old, though so timid he struggled to communicate even on the ball field. At the plate, he rarely swung at pitches, preferring to draw walks, a coach says.
>
>"(Eric) was the shyest out of everybody," says Brenden LaPier, a former teammate. "Eric was kind of the total opposite of his brother. I don't really think he wanted to play baseball all that much. It was more of a parent thing."
>
>In the fall of 1993, military cutbacks were about to hit Plattsburgh, so Major Wayne Harris decided to retire after 20 years of service. He moved his family to Littleton, renting a home in the 7000 block of West Elmhurst Avenue.
>
>It's not clear why they chose Colorado, but it ended a lifetime of military moves for Eric Harris. In his two decades in the Air Force, Wayne Harris held 11 different positions at six different bases from Oklahoma to New York. Eric went to five different schools.
>
>Now a civilian, Wayne Harris took a job at Flight Safety in Englewood, where he trained pilots to fly large refueling aircraft. Kathy Harris worked part time at a catering company on West Hampden Avenue.

1. [Marc Lépine - Childhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_L%C3%A9pine#Childhood)
>Marc Lépine was born Gamil Rodrigue Liass Gharbi on October 26, 1964, in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Algerian immigrant Rachid Liass Gharbi and Canadian nurse Monique Lépine.[3][4] Gamil's sister, Nadia, was born in 1967.[5] Rachid was a mutual funds salesman and was travelling in the Caribbean at the time of his son's birth.[6] During his absence, Monique discovered evidence that her husband had been having an affair.[7] Rachid was a non-practising Muslim, and Monique a former Catholic nun who had rejected organized religion after she left the convent.[8] Their son was baptized a Catholic as an infant, but received no religious instruction during his childhood;[4][9] his mother described her son as "a confirmed atheist all his life".[10]
>
>Instability and violence marked the family: it moved frequently, and much of Lépine's early childhood was spent in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico, where his father was working for a Swiss mutual funds company.[4][11] The family returned to Montreal permanently in 1968, shortly before a stock market crash led to the loss of much of the family's assets.[4] Rachid was an authoritarian, possessive and jealous man, frequently violent towards his wife and his children.[12] He had contempt for women and believed that they were intended only to serve men.[13] He required his wife to act as his personal secretary, slapping her if she made any errors in typing, and forcing her to retype documents in spite of the cries of their toddler.[11][14] He was also neglectful and abusive towards his children, particularly his son,[10] and discouraged any tenderness, as he considered it spoiling.[13][15][16]
>
>In 1970, following an incident in which Rachid struck Gamil so hard that the marks on his face were visible a week later, Monique decided to leave. The legal separation was finalized in 1971, and the divorce in 1976.[17][18] Following the separation, Gamil lived with his mother and younger sister Nadia; soon after, their home and possessions were seized when Rachid defaulted on mortgage payments. Gamil was afraid of his father, and at first saw him on weekly supervised visits.[17] The visits ended quickly, as Rachid ceased contact with his children soon after the separation.[4][19] Gamil never again saw his father, and in the future refused to discuss him with others.[20]
>
>Rachid stopped making child support payments after paying them twice, and to make ends meet, Monique returned to nursing.[21] She subsequently started taking further courses to advance her career. During this time the children lived with other families during the week, seeing their mother only on weekends.[4][22] Concerned about her children and parenting skills, she sought help for the family from a psychiatrist at St. Justine's Hospital in 1976; the assessment concluded there was nothing wrong with the shy and withdrawn Gamil, but recommended therapy for his sister Nadia, who was challenging her authority.[23] Nadia died in 1996 at the age of 28 from a drug overdose of cocaine.

2. [Marc Lépine - Adolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_L%C3%A9pine#Adolescence)
>After the divorce became final in 1976, the children, then aged 12 and 9, returned to live with their mother, who was director of nursing at a Montreal hospital.[24] [...] Taunted as an Arab because of his name, at the age of 14 he legally changed it to "Marc Lépine", citing his hatred of his father as the reason for taking his mother's surname.[4][26] Lépine was uncommunicative and showed little emotion.[1] He suffered from low self-esteem, exacerbated by his chronic acne.[27] Family relations remained difficult; his younger sister Nadia publicly humiliated him about his acne and his lack of girlfriends. He fantasized about her death, and on one occasion made a mock grave for her.[28] He was overjoyed when in 1981 she was placed in a group home because of her delinquent behaviour and drug abuse.[29]
>
>Seeking a good male role model for Lépine, his mother arranged for a Big Brother. For two years, the experience proved positive as Lépine, often with his best friend, enjoyed the time with photography and moto-cross motorcycles. However, in 1979, the meetings ceased abruptly when the Big Brother was detained on suspicion of molesting young boys. Both Lépine and his Big Brother denied that any molestation had occurred.[4][30] Lépine owned an air rifle as a teenager, which he used to shoot pigeons near his home with his friend. They also enjoyed designing and building electronic gadgets.[31] Lépine developed an interest in World War II and an admiration of Adolf Hitler,[32] and enjoyed action and horror movies.[33] He also took considerable responsibility at home, including cleaning and doing repairs while his mother worked.[4][34]
>
>Lépine applied to join the Canadian Forces as an officer cadet in September 1981 at the age of 17, but was rejected during the interview process. He later told his friend it was because of difficulties accepting authority, and in his suicide letter noted that he had been found to be "anti-social".[18][35] An official statement from the military after the massacre stated that he had been "interviewed, assessed and determined to be unsuitable".[4]

He changed his name from Chizuo Matsumoto to Shoko Asahara and renamed his group Aum Shinrikyo in 1987.[5][16] Asahara applied for government registration and, against the advice of cult experts and government officials,[17] the Tokyo Metropolitan Government granted it legal recognition as a religious corporation in 1989.[16]

2. [Ikuo Hayashi - Background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikuo_Hayashi#Background)
>Prior to joining Aum, Hayashi was a senior medical doctor with "an active 'front-line' track record" at the Japanese Ministry of Science and Technology (now a part of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, or MEXT in short). Himself the son of a doctor, Hayashi graduated from Keio University, one of Tokyo's top universities. He was a heart and artery specialist at Keio Hospital, which he left to become head of Circulatory Medicine at the National Sanitorium Hospital in Tokai, Ibaraki (north of Tokyo). Somewhere along the line Hayashi became disillusioned and decided to look beyond conventional medicine. He found AUM during his search.[2]
>
>In 1990 Hayashi resigned his job and left his family to join Aum and become a renunciate. He was believed to be one of Shoko Asahara's favorites and was appointed the group's "Minister of Health" with responsibilities encompassing a broad range of activities from development of a balanced "Aum diet" and supervision over "Aum hospital" to experimentations with the illegal psychedelic drug LSD[citation needed]} (which reportedly was used in one of Aum's initiations sometime in 2002).

>[Aum] forged relations with Japan's ruthless crime syndicates, the yakuza, and with veterans of the KGB and Russian and Japanese militaries. They enlisted medical doctors to dope patients and perform human experiments that belong in a horror movie. For years this went on, with barely a question from police or the media on three continents. Before long, Aum had become one of the world's richest, most sophisticated, and most murderous religious sects.

>Nidal Malik Hasan (born September 8, 1970) is a former United States Army major convicted of killing 13 people and injuring more than 30 others in the Fort Hood mass shooting on November 5, 2009.[3] Hasan was an Army Medical Corps psychiatrist. He admitted to the shootings at his court-martial in August 2013.[4][5] A jury panel of 13 officers convicted him of 13 counts of premeditated murder, 32 counts of attempted murder, and unanimously recommended he be dismissed from the service and sentenced to death.[6][7][8] Hasan is incarcerated at the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas awaiting execution.
>
>During the six years Hasan was a medical intern and resident at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, colleagues and superiors were concerned about his job performance and comments. Hasan was not married at the time, and was described as socially-isolated, stressed by his work with soldiers, and upset about their accounts of warfare.[9] Two days before the shooting, less than a month before he was due to deploy to Afghanistan, Hasan gave away many of his belongings to a neighbor.[10][3][11]
>
>Prior to the shooting, Hasan expressed critical views described by colleagues as "anti-American". An investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) concluded his e-mails with the late Imam Anwar al-Awlaki were related to his authorized professional research and he was not a threat. The FBI, Department of Defense (DoD) and U.S. Senate all conducted investigations after the shootings. The DoD classified the events as "workplace violence", pending prosecution of Hasan in a court-martial.[12] The Senate released a report describing the mass shooting as "the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001".[13][14]

>The decision by the Army to not charge Hasan with terrorism is controversial.[15]

2. [Nidal Hassan - Military service, higher education and medical career](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidal_Hasan#Military_service,_higher_education_and_medical_career)
>Hasan enlisted in the United States Army in 1988 after graduating from high school. He attended college during this time, earning an Associate's degree in science from Virginia Western Community College in 1992. In 1995, he graduated from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor's degree in biochemistry. He completed both of these programs with Latin honors.[23] He was commissioned as an officer in the Army Medical Department in 1997, and enrolled at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) in Bethesda, Maryland.[20] Hasan's performance was marginal while enrolled at USUHS. He was on academic probation during much of the six years he required to complete the four-year curriculum and graduate medical school.[24]
>
>Upon graduation from USUHS in 2003, Hasan completed his internship and residency in psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC). He completed his psychiatry training with a two-year fellowship in disaster & preventive psychiatry, earning a master’s degree in public health. During his training at Walter Reed, he received counseling and extra supervision.[25]
>
>According to The Washington Post, Hasan made a presentation titled "The Quranic World View as It Relates to Muslims in the U.S. Military" during his senior year of residency at WRAMC; it was not well received by some attendees.[26] He suggested the Department of Defense "should allow Muslims [sic] Soldiers the option of being released as "Conscientious objectors" to increase troop morale and decrease adverse events."[27][28] On a previous slide, he explained "adverse events" could be refusal to deploy, espionage, or killing of fellow soldiers. Retired Colonel Terry Lee, after working with Hasan, recalled[29] the fatal shooting of two recruiters in Little Rock, Arkansas greatly affected Hasan. The suspect Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad later claimed to be an Al Qaeda terrorist. He was charged with murder. Colonel Lee told Fox News Hasan made "outlandish" statements against the American military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, "the Muslims should stand up and fight against the aggressor", referring to American soldiers. Hasan reportedly was agitated, and frequently argued with soldiers. He expressed hope President Barack Obama would withdraw troops.[30][31]

>Despite these problems, in May 2009, Hasan was promoted to major.[20] In July 2009, Hasan was transferred to Darnall Army Medical Center in Fort Hood, Texas, moving into an undesirable area of the city of Killeen. Two weeks later, he lawfully purchased an FN Herstal 5.7 millimeter handgun.[20] Prior to his transfer, he received a 'poor performance' evaluation from supervisors and medical faculty.[32] Despite concerns, his former army boss, Lt. Col Ben Phillips, graded his performance as "outstanding". This was revealed while Phillips was a witness during Hasan's trial.[33]

3. [Nidal Hasan - Religious and ideological beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidal_Hasan#Religious_and_ideological_beliefs)
>2001-02, Anwar al-Awlaki was the Imam of the Dar al-Hijrah mosque; during that time, he was considered a moderate Muslim. Serving as the Muslim chaplain at George Washington University, he was frequently invited to speak about Islam to audiences in Washington DC and to members of Congress and the government. Hasan reportedly has deep respect for al-Awlaki's teachings.[46]
>
>Six months prior to the shootings, in December 2008, federal intelligence officials captured a series of e-mail exchanges between Al-Awlaki and Hasan. During this period, al-Awlaki was deemed a "radical cleric". However, they determined the e-mails were religious, and did not contain any elements of militancy nor any concerning subject matter.[20] Counter-terrorism specialists for the FBI reading the e-mails stated "they were consistent with authorized research Major Hasan was conducting.".[47][48][49] The e-mails contained general questions about spiritual guidance with regard to conflicts between Islam and military service, and officials judged them to be consistent with his legitimate mental health research about Muslims in the American 'armed' services.[50][51][52]
>
>After the shootings, the Yemeni journalist Abdulelah Hider Shaea interviewed al-Awlaki in November 2009 about their exchanges, and discussed their time with a Washington Post reporter. According to Shaea, Al-Awlaki said he "neither ordered nor pressured ... Hasan to harm Americans".[53] Al-Awlaki said Hasan first e-mailed him on December 17, 2008. By way of introduction, Hasan said: "Do you remember me? I used to pray with you at the Virginia mosque."[53] According to Al-Awlaki, Hasan said he was Muslim around the time the Imam was preaching at Dar al-Hijrah in 2001 and 2002. This coincides with the death of his mother.
>
>Al-Awlaki said, "Maybe Nidal was affected by one of my lectures." He added: "It was clear, from his e-mails, Nidal trusted me. Nidal told me: 'I speak with you about issues I never speak with anyone.'" Al-Awlaki said Hasan arrived at his conclusions regarding the acceptability of violence in Islam, and said he was not the one to initiate this. Shaea summarized their relationship by saying, "Nidal was providing evidence to Anwar, not vice versa."[53]

4. [Anwar al-Awlaki - Time as imam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_al-Awlaki#Time_as_imam)
>In 1994, al-Awlaki married a cousin from Yemen,[39] and began service as a part-time imam of the Denver Islamic Society. In 1996, he was chastised by an elder for encouraging a Saudi student to fight in Chechnya against the Russians.[39][49] He left Denver soon after, moving to San Diego.[50]
>
>From 1996 to 2000, al-Awlaki was imam of the Masjid Ar-Ribat al-Islami mosque in San Diego, California, where he had a following of 200–300 people.[1][42][39][40][45][51] U.S. officials later alleged that Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77, attended his sermons and personally met him during this period, although Al-Awlaki told authorities their conversations were trivial in nature.[52] Hazmi later lived in Northern Virginia and attended al-Awlaki's mosque there. The 9/11 Commission Report said that the hijackers "reportedly respected [al-Awlaki] as a religious figure".[53][39][43][51] While in San Diego, al-Awlaki volunteered with youth organizations, fished, discussed his travels with friends, and created a popular and lucrative series of recorded lectures.[39]
>
>In August 1996 and in April 1997, al-Awlaki was arrested in San Diego and charged with soliciting prostitutes.[53][34][54][55] The first time, in 1996, he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was fined $400 and required to attend informational sessions about AIDS.[54] The second time, in 1997, he pleaded guilty and was fined $240, ordered to perform 12 days of community service, and received three years' probation.[54][56] From November 2001 to January 2002 the FBI observed him visiting a number of prostitutes, and interviewed them, establishing that he had paid for sex acts.[57] No prosecution was brought.[58]
>
>In 1998 and 1999, he served as vice-president for the Charitable Society for Social Welfare. Although the FBI investigated al-Awlaki from June 1999 through March 2000 for possible links to Hamas, the Bin Laden contact Ziyad Khaleel, and a visit by an associate of Omar Abdel Rahman,[39] it did not find sufficient evidence for a criminal prosecution.[42][53][45][51][59][why?] In 2004, the FBI described this group as a "front organization to funnel money to terrorists".[45][60] Al-Awlaki told reporters that he resigned from leading the San Diego mosque "after an uneventful four years," and took a brief sabbatical, traveling overseas to various countries.[61]
>
>Al-Awlaki decided to pursue his PhD and was accepted at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and was soon recruited to be the imam of the nearby suburban Dar al-Hijrah mosque in 2000.[62] One of the mosque's board members who hired Al-Awlaki stated he was convinced that al-Awlaki had no inclinations or activities to do with terrorism.[63] The new imam, who was described as alluring and charming at this time,[64] began to draw young people to Dar Al-Hijrah[63] while connecting with the sophisticated Muslim community of Northern Virginia.[65] His proficiency as a public speaker and command of the English language helped him attract followers who did not speak Arabic. "He was the magic bullet", according to the mosque spokesman Johari Abdul-Malik. "He had everything all in a box."[66] "He had an allure. He was charming."[64] Al-Awlaki was considered a moderate during his time at Dar Al-Hijrah, publicly condemned the September 11 attacks and Al-Qaeda, was even invited to speak at the United States Department of Defense[67] and became the first imam to conduct a prayer service for the Congressional Muslim Staffer Association at the U.S. Capitol.[68][69] He led academic discussions frequented by FBI Director of Counter-Intelligence for the Middle East Gordon M. Snow. Al-Awlaki also served as the Muslim chaplain at George Washington University.[42][43][45][70] Soon after the 9/11 attacks, al-Awlaki was sought in Washington, D.C., by the media to answer questions about Islam, its rituals, and its relation to the attacks. He was interviewed by National Geographic,[71] The New York Times, and other media. Al-Awlaki condemned the attacks.[72] According to an NPR report in 2010, in 2001 al-Awlaki appeared to be a moderate who could "bridge the gap between the United States and the worldwide community of Muslims."[73] The New York Times said at the time that he was "held up as a new generation of Muslim leader capable of merging East and West."[74] In 2010, Fox News and the New York Daily News reported that some months after the 9/11 attacks, a Pentagon employee invited al-Awlaki to a luncheon in the Secretary's Office of General Counsel. The U.S. Secretary of the Army had suggested that a moderate Muslim be invited to give a talk.[75][76] In 2002, al-Awlaki was the first imam to conduct a prayer service for the Congressional Muslim Staffer Association at the U.S. Capitol.[68][69]

5. [George Washington University - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University)
>The George Washington University (GW or GWU) is a private federally chartered research university in Washington, D.C. Chartered in 1821 by the United States Congress, GWU is the largest institution of higher education in the District of Columbia.[7]
>
>George Washington, the first President of the United States, advocated for the establishment of a national university in the U.S. capital in his first State of the Union address in 1790 and continued to promote this idea throughout his career and until his death.[8][9] In his will, Washington left shares in the Potomac Company to endow the university. However, due to the company's financial difficulties, funds were raised independently by Baptist ministers.[10][11] On February 9, 1821, the university was established by an Act of Congress first as Columbian College and then as Columbian University, making it one of only five universities in the United States with a Congressional charter.[8][12]
>
>The university's undergraduate and graduate schools includes the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, the Elliott School of International Affairs, the GWU School of Business, the School of Media and Public Affairs, the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration, the GWU Law School and the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design. GWU's main Foggy Bottom campus is located in the heart of Washington, D.C., with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank located on campus and the White House and the U.S. Department of State within blocks of campus. GWU hosts numerous research centers and institutes, including the National Security Archive and the Institute for International Economic Policy. GWU also has two satellite campuses: the Mount Vernon campus, located in D.C.'s Foxhall neighborhood, and the Virginia Science and Technology Campus in Loudoun County, Virginia.
>
>GWU is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity".[13] The university offers degree programs in seventy-one disciplines, enrolling around 11,000 undergraduate and 15,500 graduate students.[14] GWU is home to extensive student life programs, a strong Greek culture, and over 450 other student organizations. The school's athletic teams, the George Washington Colonials, play in the NCAA Division I Atlantic 10 Conference. GWU also annually hosts numerous political events, including the World Bank and International Monetary Fund's Annual Meetings.[15]
>
>The university's alumni, faculty, and affiliates include 16 foreign heads of state or government, 28 United States senators, 27 United States governors, 18 U.S. Cabinet members, five Nobel laureates, two Olympic medalists, two Academy Award winners, and a Golden Globe winner.[16] GWU has over 1,100 active alumni in the U.S. Foreign Service and is one of the largest feeder schools for the diplomatic corps.[17]

>Christian Dornier was the oldest child of Georges and Jeanne Dornier; he had a sister named Corinne and a brother named Serge. Dornier served twelve months in the military around 1981, which apparently negatively affected him.[2] Dornier was described as a reserved person who liked to read and work in the forest. According to his brother he had no friends and hardly talked to anyone,[2] sometimes not talking to anyone in the nearby village of Luxiol for weeks.[3][4]
>
>One and a half years prior to the shooting, Dornier's father decided to retire and hand over the farm to him in three years. Dornier enrolled in a month-long agricultural course to prepare for taking over the farm, but he returned after a week, apparently broken. He shaved his head, began to smoke, abandoned his farm work, and became violent. Eventually Dornier's father decided not to cede the farm to him.[5] Three months prior to the shooting, Dornier, together with his father, bought a Volkswagen Golf GTI because he wanted the choice to leave the farm whenever he wished.[4]
>
>In the months prior to the rampage, Dornier fired shots at his father and his neighbour René Barrand, and pelted a woman with stones. The incidents were discussed at the village council, but it was decided that no action was needed since Dornier never had any trouble with the law. However, Dornier's family was advised to get him psychiatric help, while his father began to hide his guns.[2][6] Dornier was regularly visited by a psychiatrist from Baume-les-Dames, who prescribed him tranquilizers, but according to his brother he never took them.[2] Dornier's parents considered putting him in a psychiatric hospital, but he became furious when his doctor talked to him about the matter and his mother eventually decided against it.[6]

>In July 1989, Dornier apparently had a nervous breakdown and didn't attend the wedding of his sister on July 8. Instead, he drove through the area the entire day.[4][7]

Amri tells him he "wants to do something in Germany" and can get a Kalashnikov for an attack.

2. [Was the Berlin Christmas market attacker an undercover agent?](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/01/25/berl-j25.html)
>A report published just over a week ago by the Federal Criminal Office (BKA) raises the question of whether Anis Amri was an intelligence agent.\
[...]\
>Just days after the attack, it was already clear that Amri had prepared the attack under the noses of the police and intelligence agencies. He had been under constant surveillance over the previous two years and was in contact with an agent with the North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) state intelligence agency.
>
>On the basis of the BKA’s confidential report, it is possible to reconstruct Amri’s activities in Germany quite precisely. The police and intelligence agencies concentrated on Amri almost weekly and followed all of his actions.
>
>Amri came from Italy to Germany in the summer of 2015. He had already received a four-year custodial sentence. He was initially sent to a refugee accommodation centre in Emmerich (Kreis Kleve), NRW.
>
>Already at that time, the 22-year-old was noticed because he had pictures of ISIS fighters on his mobile phone. In December 2015, other refugees reported to the immigration authorities in Kreis Kleve that he “supposedly maintained contact with Islamic State.” Eventually, the authorities were aware of 14 identities used by Amri.
>
>Amri became involved with the Salafist movement, into which the NRW state intelligence agency had embedded at least one agent. He reported repeatedly to the police about Amri. “The source spilled over,” wrote the Süddeutsche Zeitung, which saw the BKA report. These reports filled entire files. 
>
>On the basis of these reports, the state prosecutor ordered Amri’s phone to be tapped in November 2015. Somewhat later, Italian intelligence agencies sent photos and detailed personal information to Germany.
>
>In February 2016, the intelligence agent reported that Amri was becoming more withdrawn and reading the Koran, as if he wanted to be purified as some suicide attackers do prior to an attack. He was designated as a “threat” by the NRW state intelligence agency.
>
>At the same time, the state BKA in NRW sent their intelligence about the Islamist network in which Amri was involved to the state prosecutor in Karlsruhe. The top German prosecutor took up an investigation against the group for supporting terrorism and recruitment for a terrorist organisation and in November ordered the arrest of its leader, Abu Walaa, as well as the hardcore members of the group. However, Anis Amri was left at large.
>
>A variety of intelligence agencies were now watching him as he travelled regularly between Dortmund and Berlin. He was driven at least once by the intelligence agent. Between March and September, the Berlin state prosecutor conducted an investigation into Amri. He was intercepted and observed, but allegedly not for terrorist planning but for petty drug trafficking. According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the BKA report alleges that “religious questions” supposedly fell into the background during Ramadan.

>28-year-old Ian David Long [...] served in the United States Marine Corps from August 2008 to March 2013, reaching the rank of corporal, and he had gone to Afghanistan from November 2010 to June 2011. After being honorably discharged, Long attended California State University, Northridge as an athletic training major from 2013 to 2016, but he did not graduate.[12][39] During this time, he had been involved in a motorcycle accident that left him with a collapsed lung; his motorcycle helmet was cracked, and he was diagnosed with "adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), combat and military operational stress reaction, and chronic pain."[12] According to his mother, he had begun to "unravel" after the incident. Long had two prior contacts with the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, one in 2006 involving a traffic collision and the other in 2015 involving a bar fight; no charges were filed in either incident.[12]
>
>Police and a mental health crisis team visited Long in 2017 for his irate and irrational behavior, but they decided not to detain him at a psychiatric facility.[39][40] A high school teacher raised claims that Long had physically assaulted her as a student but she was encouraged not to push the incident so as to not endanger his future in the Marine Corps. In her statement, the teacher alleged that Long had issues long before his military service.[41] Although he had served overseas in the military, behavioral scientist and clinical psychologist Lisa Jaycox said that it was premature to say whether Long suffered from PTSD or if it was a factor in the shooting.[37][11][42]

>Mark Barton was born on April 2, 1955, in Stockbridge, Georgia, to an Air Force family and was raised in South Carolina. He attended Clemson University and the University of South Carolina, where he earned a degree in chemistry despite an ongoing drug habit. Back in Atlanta, Barton married Debra Spivey, with whom he had two children named Matthew and Mychelle.[5]
>
>Barton's family moved to Alabama as his employer required him there. Barton grew paranoid and started distrusting his wife. He lost his employment after his performance plummeted. He was also caught sabotaging data of the company that had fired him and served a short jail term for this retaliatory act.[5] Barton found a new employer in Georgia and a mistress in one of his wife's acquaintances, with whom he had an affair. In 1993, Spivey and her mother Eloise were killed by bludgeoning. Barton was the prime suspect in the double-murder, but was not charged due to the lack of evidence.[5] He married his former mistress, Leigh Ann Vandiver, in 1995. His mental health continued to deteriorate, however, and he began to suffer from both severe depression and paranoid delusions.[5]

>Barton had received a $294,000 insurance settlement from his first wife's death and used the funds to finance his day trading career, preferring high risk Internet-related stocks.[6] In the month prior to his killing spree, Barton had lost $105,000, and Momentum Securities had cancelled his account.[6]

>In 2007, Bird was beaten unconscious by four men who tried to run instead of paying him for taxi services. Friends said he changed after the attack.[29] It was reported that Bird had previously sought help from a local hospital due to his fragile mental state, although these reports were unconfirmed.[30] He had held a shotgun certificate since 1974 and had renewed it several times, most recently in 2005, and had held a firearms certificate for a rifle from 2007 onward.[31][32] Bird was being investigated by HM Revenue and Customs at the time of the shooting.[33] His body was formally identified at Furness General Hospital in Barrow-in-Furness,[34] and he was cremated at a private service on 18 June 2010.[35]

>Police investigating the killings have also found that Bird was the subject of an ongoing tax investigation by HM Revenue and Customs for tax evasion and the threat of possible future prosecution and punishment might have contributed to his action.[40] According to Mark Cooper, a fellow taxi driver who had known him for fifteen years, Bird had accumulated £60,000 in a secret bank account and was worried he would be sent to prison for hiding the cash from the government.[41] He reportedly believed his brother and the solicitor were conspiring to send him to prison for tax evasion; in the three days before the killings, Bird called his brother forty-four times.[42]

3. [Sellafield - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sellafield)
>Sellafield is a large multi-function nuclear site close to Seascale on the coast of Cumbria, England. As of July 2020, activities at the site include nuclear waste storage and nuclear decommissioning, and it is a former nuclear power generating site. Nuclear fuel reprocessing ceased on 17th July 2022, when the Magnox reprocessing plant completed its last batch of fuel after 58 years of operation.[1]. The licensed site covers an area of 265 hectares (650 acres),[2] and comprises more than 200 nuclear facilities and more than 1,000 buildings.[3] It is Europe's largest nuclear site and has the most diverse range of nuclear facilities in the world situated on a single site.[4]
>
>Sellafield site's legacy facilities include the UK's first generation nuclear pile reactors and associated fuel re-processing facilities, and Calder Hall Nuclear power station, the world's first nuclear power station to export electricity on a commercial scale to a public grid. The UK's National Nuclear Laboratory has its Central Laboratory and headquarters on the site.
>
>Sellafield was the site in 1957 of one of the world's worst nuclear incidents. This was the Windscale fire which occurred when uranium metal fuel ignited inside Windscale Pile no.1. Radioactive contamination was released into the environment, which it is now estimated caused around 240 cancers in the long term, with 100 to 240 of these being fatal.[5][6][7] The incident was rated 5 out of a possible 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale.[5]
>
>Originally built as a Royal Ordnance Factory in 1942, the site briefly passed into the ownership of Courtaulds for rayon manufacture following WW2, but was re-acquired by the Ministry of Supply in 1947 for the production of plutonium for nuclear weapons, and was given the name "Windscale Works". Subsequent key developments include the building of Calder Hall nuclear power station, the Magnox fuel reprocessing plant, the prototype Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) and the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP).
>
>Decommissioning projects include the Windscale Piles,[8] Calder Hall nuclear power station, and a number of historic reprocessing facilities and waste stores. The site currently directly employs about 10,000 people, and is owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which is a non-departmental public body of the UK government. Following a period 2008–2016 of management by a private consortium, the site has been returned to direct government control by making the Site Management Company, Sellafield Ltd, a subsidiary of the NDA. Decommissioning of legacy facilities, some of which date back to the UK's first efforts to produce an atomic bomb, is planned for completion by 2120 at a cost of £121 billion.[9]

>Alexis [...] joined the Navy in May 2007[10] and served in Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 46 at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth.[28] His rating was aviation electrician's mate, and he had attained the rank of petty officer third class when he was honorably discharged from the Navy on January 31, 2011, although the Navy originally intended for him to receive a general discharge.[29]
>
>According to a Navy official, Alexis was cited on at least eight occasions for misconduct.[30] In 2010, he was arrested in Fort Worth for discharging a weapon within city limits.[31][32] He was also arrested in 2004 in Seattle, Washington, for malicious mischief after shooting out the tires of another man's vehicle in what he described as an anger-fueled "blackout",[26][33][34] and for disorderly conduct in 2008 in DeKalb County, Georgia.[35] None of his arrests led to prosecution,[36] so there was no penalty for his actions.

2. [Washington Navy Yard shooting - Professional work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Navy_Yard_shooting#Professional_work)
>Alexis received a secret-level security clearance in March 2008 that was valid for ten years. Following the Navy Yard shooting, it was found that the federal personnel report, which led to the clearance's approval, did not mention that his 2004 arrest had involved a firearm. Alexis said on his clearance application that he had never been charged with a felony and that he had not been arrested in the last seven years; the personnel report said that he had given these answers because the 2004 charge had been dismissed.[37][38] This security clearance investigation was conducted by USIS, the same contractor that had vetted Edward Snowden. The Department of Justice has filed fraud charges against USIS in a whistleblower case filed as United States of America ex rel. Blake Percival vs USIS.[39][40]
>
>Alexis worked in Japan from September 2012 to January 2013 on the Navy Marine Corps Intranet network for an HP Enterprise Services sub-contracting company called The Experts.[41] After returning from Japan, he expressed frustration to a former roommate that he had not been paid properly for the work that he performed.[28][41] Another roommate said that he would frequently complain about being the victim of discrimination.[42][43] In July 2013, he resumed working for The Experts in the United States.[41]

3. [Washington Navy Yard shooting - Mental health issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Navy_Yard_shooting#Mental_health_issues)
>After the Navy Yard shooting, the media speculated that Alexis had appeared to be suffering from mental illness. The media reported that Alexis had filed a police report in Rhode Island on August 2, 2013. He claimed to be the victim of harassment and that he was hearing voices in his head.[48] According to an FBI official after the shooting, Alexis was under the "belief that he was being controlled or influenced by extremely low-frequency electromagnetic waves". A message later obtained by federal authorities from Alexis's personal computing devices said, "Ultra low frequency attack is what I've been subject to for the last 3 months. And to be perfectly honest, that is what has driven me to this."[49]
>
>On August 4, 2013, naval police were called to Alexis's hotel at Naval Station Newport and found that he had "taken apart his bed, believing someone was hiding under it, and observed that Alexis had taped a microphone to the ceiling to record the voices of people that were following him". At the time of the incident, he was working for the contractor at the base.[50]
>
>On August 23, Alexis showed up at a Providence, Rhode Island, emergency room complaining of insomnia. He was prescribed 50 milligrams of trazodone, a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor antidepressant.[51] Five days later, he sought treatment for insomnia in the emergency room of a VA medical center in Washington, D.C., where he told doctors he was not depressed and was not thinking of harming others. He was given ten more tablets of trazodone.[52]

4. [Washington Navy Yard shooting - Prior to the shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Navy_Yard_shooting#Prior_to_the_shooting)
>At the time of the shooting, Alexis had been working for a subcontractor on a Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Services contract supporting a Navy-Marine Corps (NMCI) computer network.[16] Alexis arrived in the Washington, D.C., area on or around August 25, 2013, and stayed at various hotels to escape the voices. At the time of the massacre, he had been staying with five other civilian contractors at the Residence Inn hotel he booked into in southwest Washington, D.C., since September 7.[16][53]
>
>On Saturday, September 14, two days before the massacre, Alexis visited the Sharpshooters Small Arms Range in Lorton, Virginia, 15 miles (24 km) south of Washington. He tested an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle but did not seek to buy it, a lawyer for the store said. After testing the rifle, Alexis inquired about buying a handgun at the store, but was told federal law does not allow dealers to sell such guns directly to out-of-state customers. Alexis instead purchased a Remington Model 870 Express Tactical 12-gauge shotgun and two boxes of shells, after passing a state and federal background check.[54][55] Before the shooting, Alexis sawed off the shotgun and scratched the phrases "Better off this way!", "My ELF weapon!", "Not what yall say!", and "End to the torment!" onto the gun's receiver.[56]

5. [Did Antidepressant Play a Role in Navy Yard Massacre?](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/did-antidepressant-play-a-role-in-navy-yard-massacre/)
>Once again, antidepressants have been linked to an episode of horrific violence. The New York Times reports that Aaron Alexis, who allegedly shot 12 people to death at a Navy facility in Washington, D.C., earlier this week, received a prescription for the antidepressant trazodone in August.
>[...]\
>Alexis, who was 34, was reportedly seeking treatment for insomnia when he received his prescription for trazodone. Originally marketed as an antidepressant after its approval by the FDA in 1981, trazodone is also prescribed for anxiety and insomnia. Trazodone was a precursor of the extremely popular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); like the SSRIs, trazodone boosts levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin.
>
>A website maintained by the National Institutes of Health states that trazodone and other antidepressants have been associated with "new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and frenzied abnormal excitement."

>Unruh enlisted in the United States Army on October 27, 1942, and saw active service as an armor crewman across Europe between October 1944 and July 1945.[9][10] He was remembered by his Section Chief, Norman E. Koehn, as a first-class soldier who never drank, swore, or chased girls, and spent much time reading his Bible and writing long letters to his mother.[11] It was also cited that Unruh kept meticulous notes on the enemies killed in battles, down to the details of the corpses. He was awarded the European Theater of Operations Medal, the Victory Medal, and the Good Conduct Medal. Unruh was honorably discharged at the end of the war and returned to New Jersey to live with his mother. Both his brother and his father later indicated that Unruh's wartime experiences had changed him, making him moody, nervous and detached.

Holmes, who was described by his supervisor as stubborn, uncommunicative and socially inept, presented his project to the other interns at the end of the internship, but never completed it.[41][42]
>
>Holmes wrote of his experience at the Salk Institute in a college application essay: "I had little experience in computer programming and the work was challenging to say the least. Nonetheless, I taught myself how to program in Flash and then construct a cross-temporal calibration model.... Completing the project and presenting my model at the end of the internship was exhilarating."[43]
>
>Graduating from Westview High School in the Torrey Highlands community of San Diego in 2006,[44][45] Holmes attended the University of California, Riverside (UCR). In 2010, he received his undergraduate B.S. degree in neuroscience with highest honors.[46][47][48][49] He was a member of several honor societies, including Phi Beta Kappa and Golden Key.[50] According to UCR recommendation letters submitted to the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (UIUC), Holmes graduated in the top 1 percent of his class with a 3.949 GPA. The UCR letters also described Holmes as "a very effective group leader" and a person who "takes an active role in his education, and brings a great amount of intellectual and emotional maturity into the classroom".[51] Holmes scored in the 98th percentile on the verbal portion, the 94th percentile on the quantitative portion and the 45th percentile on the analytical writing portion of the Graduate Record Examinations.[52]
>
>In the summer of 2008, Holmes worked as a counselor at a residential summer camp in Glendale, California, which served children aged 7–14. There, he was responsible for ten children and had no disciplinary problems.[53]
>
>In the fall of 2010, Holmes was employed at a pill and capsule-coating factory in San Diego County. One of his co-workers later said that Holmes was unsociable, and once acted strangely at a laboratory work station by staring at a blank wall and not verbally responding, only making a quick glance and smirking, when his co-worker asked if he was okay.[54]
>
>In June 2011, Holmes enrolled as a Ph.D. student in neuroscience at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora.[55] He received a $21,600 grant from the National Institutes of Health, according to agency records, which was disbursed in installments from July 2011 to June 2012. Holmes also received a $5,000 stipend from the University of Colorado, Denver.[56][57] Though Holmes received a letter of acceptance to UIUC, where he was offered a $22,600 stipend and free tuition, he declined their offer without specifying a reason. Reviewers of Holmes' application at UIUC remembered his application in part because he submitted a picture of himself with a llama.[51]
>
>Beginning in graduate school, Holmes would see shadows and "flickers" at the corners of his eyes, which would fight each other with firearms and other weapons.[58] At the University of Colorado, Holmes sought help in 2012 for his mental state at the student health clinic after he broke up with his girlfriend. Because he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, his caregivers were allowed to testify at his trial. He was seen by psychiatrist Dr. Lynne Fenton, who testified at his trial that she was worried about his homicidal ideation expressed in their last meeting. She saw him a total of seven times over three months, twice with a male psychiatrist. Holmes rejected their suggestions for treatment. In June 2012 after Holmes had sent her a threatening email, she activated a threat assessment team to help her formulate a plan for Holmes. She expressed concerns about his social phobia and "psychotic-level thinking" and believed he may have had schizoid personality disorder. She listed specific concerns, such as his long-standing fantasies about killing as many people as possible, his reluctance to discuss any details about his plans, his refusal to allow them to talk to anyone else and the unclear timeline; she didn't know if he was always that way or if this was a new behavior. She consulted with his mother, who said he had longstanding social problems. Although the center offered to treat him if he lost his insurance, he left treatment.[59]
>
>In 2012, Holmes' academic performance declined,[60] and he scored poorly on the comprehensive exam in the spring. The university was not planning to expel him; however, Holmes was in the process of withdrawing from the university.[61] Three days after failing a key oral exam at the university in early June 2012, Holmes dropped out of his studies without further explanation.[62] At the time of his arrest, he gave his occupation as "laborer."[63]

>According to his LinkedIn profile, James Holmes's father, Dr. Robert Holmes, who received a PhD in Statistics in 1981 from the University of California at Berkeley, worked for San Diego-based HNC Software, Inc. from 2000 to 2002. HNC, known as a "neural network" company, and DARPA, beginning in 1998, have worked on developing "cortronic neural networks," which would allow machines to interpret aural and visual stimuli to think like humans. The cortronic concept was developed by HNC Software's chief scientist and co-founder, Robert Hecht-Nielsen. HNC merged with the Minneapolis-based Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO), a computer analysis and decision-making company. Robert Holmes continues to work at FICO.

3. [Colorado Shooter James Holmes’ Family History Goes Back to the Mayflower](https://www.thedailybeast.com/colorado-shooter-james-holmes-family-history-goes-back-to-the-mayflower)
>James Holmes's relatives, who descended from the Pilgrims, had a very different relationship to arms.
>
>As she presided over the regular luncheon meetings of the Monterey Bay Colony of Mayflower Descendants, Mary Jane Crawford Holmes represented a lineage stretching proudly back to the original Pilgrims.
>
>She never could have imagined that her family’s landing on Plymouth Rock would extend almost four centuries later to a grandson accused of mass murder at a Batman movie.\
>[...]\
>By all accounts, the Stanford-educated Holmes had always lived up to the principles of the predecessors in whom she is said to have taken an increasing interest after retiring from a long career as a librarian. She had determined that she was a kind of American aristocrat, genealogically speaking. She was descended not only from the Pilgrims, but also from a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Boston, the first American militia. This was the type of outfit that the Second Amendment of the Constitution refers to as “a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.”
>
>Robert Holmes had been a career officer in the standing army that was subsequently established to keep the country secure. He fought in the Pacific during World War II and stayed on, serving as a lieutenant colonel in charge of a Nike antiaircraft battery in San Francisco at the time of the Cuban missile crisis. He retired in 1963 and began a second career as a teacher at the private York School in Monterey, where his wife served as a librarian. Both their sons graduated from York: the older James in 1967; Robert Jr. in 1969.
>
>The younger Robert went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in mathematics at Stanford, a master’s in biostatistics at UCLA, and a doctorate in statistics at the University of California at Berkeley in 1981. His doctoral thesis was titled “Contributions to the Theory of Parametric Estimation in Randomly Censored Data.” He subsequently authored studies for the Navy and the Marine Corps on how to forecast personnel changes using something called “tree classifications,” the trees in question being statistical. Eventually, reports say, he signed on as a low-six-figure-a-year senior scientist with FICO, which produces management systems, fraud protection, and credit scores. He married Arlene Holmes, a nurse.

>
>Lt. Col. Robert M. Holmes, who served in the Okinawa campaign during World War II, retired in 1963 as the last commander of the Nike missile group in San Francisco Bay. He was one of the first Turkish language students at the Army Language School, now the Defense Language Institute, graduating in 1948, a school spokesman confirmed Friday.

>After his military retirement, Holmes taught math and science at York School for 17 years. He died in 1990. His wife, Mary Jane Crawford Holmes, attended Stanford University and worked at the Monterey City Library, Fort Ord Library and Pacific Grove High School before finishing her career as librarian and college counselor at York School. She died in 2010.

In the following scuffle, Pough grabbed a .38-caliber revolver from his girlfriend's purse and shot Pender three times, who eventually died in a hospital. According to relatives, he never managed to get over the fact that he had killed his friend.

>Pough was initially charged with murder, though the charge was later reduced to manslaughter. In the end, he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced to five years probation, but the judgment of his guilt was withheld by the court subject to the successful completion of probation.[3]
>
>Due to Pough's violent behavior in the past, it was also ruled that he should never be allowed to own a gun, though this was never forwarded to police. As a result, Pough was not considered a felon and therefore was able to purchase several handguns, among them the Röhm RG-31 .38-caliber revolver he later used to commit suicide, which was registered with the police on June 4, 1979. In 1977, Pough appeared twice in court for charges of bad debt, and there was also an outstanding warrant for his arrest in a 1982 employment compensation fraud case.

>Willi Walter Seifert (19 June 1921 – 11 June 1964) was born in Bickendorf, a district of Cologne.[4] He was the son of a glass-grinder and had one brother. From 1927 to 1935 he attended the Volksschule in Ehrenfeld, and afterwards started an apprenticeship as metal worker at a machine factory, which he successfully finished in 1939. In 1941 he was drafted into the Luftwaffe and attended the Waffentechnische Schule der Luftwaffe (Weaponry Technology School of the Airforce) for a year. By the end of the war he was a sergeant in an anti-aircraft battery and afterwards was a prisoner of war for several months.
>
>Seifert worked for a Cologne car factory, before joining the Schutzpolizei on 14 November 1945. On 23 August 1946 he was treated for a bronchial catarrh, and an examination by a specialist on 5 September diagnosed with tuberculosis in the right lung, resulting in his dismissal from the police on 30 September, as he was unfit for service. From then on Seifert attempted to enforce his claims for subsistence, feeling he was being treated unfairly by the government which he claimed was cheating him of his war pension.
>
>In 1953 his tuberculosis was found to be inactive and Seifert declared to have a reduced earning capacity of 30%, though any causality between his illness and his imprisonment during the war was denied. Seifert contested this, accused the doctors of creating false medical reports and complained in long letters to various authorities about his problems.
>
>In August 1954 Seifert was examined by a public health officer, who was of the opinion that he was not in need of a regimen, but suggested that he could be sent to a sanatorium for observation. The doctor also noted in his report that Seifert was a mentally devious person with no will to recover. Seifert again contested the report and wrote a letter titled "Sozialpolitik - Sozialärzte — Sozialmord" (social politics — social doctors — social murder), whereupon he was examined by a medical specialist for neurology and psychiatry, who noted Seifert's quirky behaviour, his scattered train of thought, and his constant smile in inappropriate situations. He also recorded that Seifert harboured paranoid thoughts about his doctors and showed a peculiar fanatical beha

>
>According to his LinkedIn profile, he was a student at Seneca College in North York from 2011 to 2018 and lived in Richmond Hill. Minassian had attended Sixteenth Avenue Public School, an elementary school in Richmond Hill, in a special education class.[45][44] His former classmates at Thornlea Secondary School in Thornhill described him as "not overly social" and "harmless".[28][46] Minassian attended a special needs class for students within the autism spectrum while at Thornlea Secondary School;[47] Minassian's mother is quoted as saying in a 2009 article that her son has Asperger syndrome.[48]
>
>In late 2017, Minassian enrolled in the Canadian Armed Forces for two months, before requesting voluntary release after 16 days of recruit training.[47] A senior military official said that Minassian "wasn't adapting to military life, including in matters of dress, deportment and group interactions in a military setting" and "there were no red flags and nothing that would point to anything like this."[48]\
>
>Following the attack, a Facebook post made by Minassian was uncovered in which he identified himself as an incel ("involuntary celibate").[28][51] The state of involuntary celibacy refers to being unable to find sexual partners[52] and its subculture consists of primarily male online communities.[53][54] The post, dated shortly before the beginning of the attack on April 23, allegedly read:
>

>[...]\
>Minassian had a natural aptitude for computers, and pursued a computer programming diploma at Seneca’s campus at York University, not far from his Richmond Hill home. He did well in his classes, earning a coveted gig as a research assistant at Seneca’s Centre for Development of Open Technology, a position that could open doors into entry-level jobs at prestigious software companies like Red Hat and Mozilla.\
[...]\
>At one point, he took a job as a quality-assurance developer at Toogood Financial Systems, an investment software firm based in Richmond Hill. After six months, he was fired. He did a co-op placement with OMERS, but they didn’t invite him back to work full-time.\
>[...]\
>In September 2017, Minassian left home for the first time. His parents encouraged him to join the army, so, one semester before he was due to complete his degree at Seneca, he quit school to enlist. He passed his entrance assessment, including an aptitude test, a medical exam, a fitness test and an interview, and reported for his first day of training at a military facility in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec—recruit number C23249161. To his fellow recruits, he seemed shy and withdrawn.
>
>In a matter of days, it became clear that Minassian was the weak link in an otherwise strong platoon. Andrew Summerfield, his section leader, was concerned. Minassian never should have passed the entrance exam, Summerfield thought. He didn’t have the motor control to complete simple stopping drills: when the recruits were ordered to swing their right legs without moving their bodies, Minassian stumbled. His physical tics—hand to cheek, hand to ear, then hand to nose—were so pronounced that they distracted the other recruits in class. He seemed oblivious to the constraints of time, falling woefully behind in exercises. He even had trouble packing his kit, wandering around the drill hall aimlessly, unsure of what he needed. More than anything, Minassian seemed absent, locked in the confines of his mind. He usually sat alone, and always answered questions with monosyllabic indifference. He never made eye contact, looking down to the floor when he spoke. Summerfield knew Minassian never would have qualified for a civilian firearm licence—so why was he admitted to the armed forces as an infantry soldier?
>
>Within a few days, the other recruits were talking about Minassian behind his back, frustrated that he was making the platoon look bad. In the evenings, when the others would gather in the barracks to joke and commiserate, Minassian stayed in his bunk. He knew he didn’t fit in. Summerfield developed a system to help Minassian. Each morning, he would wake with the others at 5 a.m. and rush to complete his own tasks, making sure to leave himself enough time to help Minassian before inspection. There was something wrong nearly every day, and Minassian never seemed to understand why. He’d make his bed improperly, no matter how many times Summerfield showed him hospital corners. His uniform would be unkempt, or his clothes folded incorrectly in his kit. Summerfield was baffled. “It seemed like he didn’t understand the gravity of the situation he was in,” he says. Instructors barked orders at him, making him do one push-up for each loose thread on his uniform, or making the entire platoon do push-ups for Minassian’s mistakes.
>
>By the second week of training, Summerfield was going to great lengths to get Minassian to complete the basic tasks that would keep his section off the instructors’ hit lists. He showed him how to shape his beret properly, suggesting that he shower with it on and let it dry on his head. “It was like when you trick kids into doing stuff,” he says.
>
>By the third week, Minassian had come down with a strain of strep throat so common in basic training that recruits joke it’s unique to the forces. He went to the infirmary. When he didn’t come back, an instructor ordered Summerfield to go find him. He walked into the barracks and saw Minassian curled in his bed. “I don’t want to be here anymore,” he told Summerfield. “I want to go home.”
>
Sixteen days in, Minassian asked to be discharged. When he stood to leave, his fellow recruits breathed a collective sigh of relief. “It was in the back of our minds that giving this guy a firearm probably wouldn’t go well,” Summerfield says. He didn’t seem violent or angry—they just didn’t think he’d be able to learn how to use it properly.
>
>That winter, Minassian returned to Seneca to complete his final semester. In one class, the students played two truths and a lie as an icebreaker. He mentioned he’d been in the army but left during training. When a fellow student asked why, Minassian told him it was because he didn’t get to use guns as often as he’d hoped. It didn’t sound like he was joking.

Saari, a Hospitality Management student at the school,[36] was expelled from the Finnish Army in 2006, after serving for only a month, for opening fire in a woodland exercise against orders.[37] Saari had been the victim of bullying in secondary school and dropped out of his classes for this reason.[21] A friend of Saari also reported that he had been seeing a psychologist in the months before the shooting, and had been obsessed with guns.[38] Saari said that he "always wanted to kill as many people as possible."
>
>In his youth, Saari suffered from health problems. His early childhood was marked by slow growth and frequent illness. His brother died when he was 17 years old, which devastated him. He was very shy and sensitive. According to psychologist Peter Langman, Saari seems to have displayed signs of avoidant personality disorder and later possibly schizotypal personality disorder. He was a target of bullying in his school years and he suffered from anxiety, panic attacks and depression. During his month-long service in the Finnish Army, Saari was described as "weird and silent" and had difficulties fitting in. In his last years, he heavily used alcohol and was arrested for driving under the influence.[35]

1. [James RUPPERT - Murderpedia](https://mail.murderpedia.org/male.R/r/ruppert-james.htm)
>It didn't help that Ruppert's five-foot eleven-inch 36-year-old father died of complications from tuberculosis when James was only 12 years old, forcing him to assume adult responsibilities from an early age. Ruppert told psychiatrists that, after his father's death, his mother would beat and taunt him and would encourage his brother Leonard to do the same.
>
>From James's viewpoint, his mother had made very clear to him that his presence was a mistake; that she had wanted a girl, not another boy in the family. At the age of 16, things at home got so bad that Ruppert ran away and later attempted suicide by hanging himself with a sheet. Though he failed in this attempt, the thought of suicide was something that stayed with Ruppert for decades to come. 
>
>Ruppert's mother showered love on her older son, who became a constant reminder to James of his own inadequacies. Leonard was the male head of the household after their father's death, whereas James always felt like an outcast in his own family; Leonard played sports while James sat on the sidelines; James was very conscious of being five inches shorter than his brother; James's math and science teachers always compared him with his older brother whose grades in the same classes had been superior; Leonard graduated from night school with a degree in electrical engineering, whereas James flunked out of college after two years; Leonard became a successful engineer with General Electric, whereas brother James went from job to job; Leonard was happily married with eight children, whereas James never married, was jilted by his only fiancée, and continued to live with his mother. Moreover, James had dated the woman whom his brother would later marry and had even introduced them to one another. 
>
>By his own standards, James was as much a failure as his brother Leonard was a success. To make matters worse, Leonard was, at least in his younger brother's mind, a vicious sadist and torturer - in a word, he was the enemy. Going back to early childhood, James still remembered his brother locking him in closets, tying him with rope, beating him with a hose, and sitting on his head until he screamed out loud. The image only worsened over time; and, by James's 30th birthday, he was just beginning to see Leonard as the executioner - as a major figure in what he believed to be an emerging conspiracy against him. 
>
>The paranoia really escalated in 1965, when the Hamilton Police Department determined that James had made an obscene phone call to an employee of the local public library where James spent much free time. Although admitting making the call, James was convinced that his mother and brother were attempting to discredit him by informing everyone of his transgression and reporting to the FBI that he was a communist and homosexual.
>
>He also believed that the FBI was tapping his telephone not only at home, but also in the restaurants and bars he happened to visit. Over the years, he felt, the intrusion of the FBI into his personal life continued to grow. Other groups were also implicated by Ruppert in the plot to sabotage his career, his social contacts, and his car. By 1975, he told psychiatrists of being followed by the State Highway Patrol, the local Sheriff's Department, private detectives, and the Hamilton Police.

>According to interviews and information gathered by journalist Lawrence Wright, the group was recruiting military officers and accumulating weapons, waiting for the right moment to launch "a complete overthrow of the existing order" in Egypt. Chief strategist of El-Jihad was Abbud al-Zumar, a colonel in the military intelligence whose "plan was to kill the main leaders of the country, capture the headquarters of the army and State Security, the telephone exchange building, and of course the radio and television building, where news of the Islamic revolution would then be broadcast, unleashing—he expected—a popular uprising against secular authority all over the country."[9]

>
>He was commissioned as an officer in the Mechanized Infantry forces of the Egyptian Army in 1969 and served with distinction, commanding a platoon of BMP-1 armoured vehicles and an Anti-Tank company in the Yom Kippur War. His Anti-Tank company achieved at least 24 Israeli tank kills during the war. He joined the Military Intelligence department in 1974. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1979.

Sometime after this appointment, Islambouli joined the proscribed Egyptian Islamic Jihad movement. Between 1976 and 1980, he served mostly as a staff officer or as fire direction officer for various artillery batteries, battalions and regiments. In March 1980, he got his first field command, an artillery platoon gun line in the 116th Field Artillery Brigade based in Cairo. His command included three 'active' field howitzers, a reserve field gun, five to six transport trucks, seven jeeps, signaling equipment, light infantry weapons such as assault rifles, medium machine guns, anti-tank rockets, light mortars, and sniper rifles for organic defence, and around 45 soldiers/conscripts, with a second lieutenant and a sergeant acting as second-in-command and third-in-command respectively. His role was to take firing missions and orders from the Battery HQ.

He developed an "irrational worldview" in which he believed that the people he hated were infected with a virus and must be exterminated.[9] On the day of the shooting, Sonboly saved a document on his computer in which he wrote "The bullying will be paid back today".[74] During the shooting itself, he shouted that he had been bullied for seven years.[77]

Source(s):
1. [Mark Essex - Adolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Essex#Adolescence)
>Shortly after graduating from high school, Essex briefly enrolled at Emporia State University. He dropped out after just one semester, and briefly worked in the same meat-packing plant as his father as he considered his next career or educational move. Concluding his horizons were limited in Emporia, shortly after his 19th birthday, Essex decided to enlist in the United States Army. Upon the advice of his father, a World War II veteran, he instead opted to join the Navy and seek vocational training.[8]

2. [Mark Essex - Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Essex#Navy)
>Essex enlisted the Navy on January 13, 1969, committing himself to a four-year contract at advanced pay. Within three months, he was assigned to the Naval Air Station at Imperial Beach, California. His family would later reflect that, as Essex prepared to enlist, he was "happy go lucky".[9]
>
>Initially, Essex's experiences in the Navy were positive. He performed his compulsory training at the Naval Training Center with exemplary results. His superiors recommended he enroll in the Navy Dental Center. Essex accepted this advice and was apprenticed as a dental technician in April 1969, specializing in endodontics and periodontics.[10] He soon formed a close and ongoing friendship with his white supervisor, Lieutenant Robert Hatcher. However, Essex soon learned that bigotry from many of the white servicemen towards blacks (both overt and discreet) was a general everyday occurrence for blacks serving within the Navy. Shortly after his enlistment, Essex obtained a job as a bartender at an enlisted men's club named the Jolly Rotor, where he discovered that certain rooms were off-limits to blacks.[11] In one letter to his mother, Essex wrote his experiences of racial relations within the Navy were "not like [he] thought [they] would be. Not like Emporia. Blacks have trouble getting along here."[12]
>
>Throughout 1969, Essex suffered these indignities quietly—apparently believing what he had been told by other black recruits: that he would be treated better once he achieved a higher rank.[13] Within a year, he had risen to the rank of seaman, although the harassment continued, and he began taking sedatives. Shortly thereafter, Essex formed a close friendship with a black colleague named Rodney Frank; a self-described black militant who worked in the Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department. The two regularly socialized in their off-duty hours, and by the summer of 1970, Essex had become markedly radicalized. Frank also encouraged Essex to read literature about individuals such as Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, who together had founded the Black Panther Party.[14]
>
>Several months after Essex's acquaintance with Frank, in August 1970, he became involved in a physical altercation with a white NCO moments after hearing the individual state his belief "how beautiful" it must have been in decades past when "a nigger went to sea it was below decks, in the galley".[15] Although Essex and his adversary agreed to a compromise to avoid either being admonished for the altercation, the fact he had struck a white recruit of senior rank increased the level of harassment and intimidation he was subjected to from white personnel. Two months later, on the morning of October 19, Essex went absent without leave (AWOL) from the Navy. He phoned his mother from a bus station, informing her: "I'm coming home. I've just got to have some time to think."[16]

3. [Mark Essex - AWOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Essex#AWOL)
>Essex returned via a Greyhound bus to Emporia, and remained AWOL until November 16, 1970. While AWOL, he repeatedly described to his family his experiences of overt discrimination at the hands of many of the white Navy recruits, his overt bitterness, and his resultant growing hatred towards the white race. Although his family attempted to reason with Essex against this viewpoint, Essex exclaimed: "What else is there? They take everything from you. Your dignity, your pride. What can you do but hate them?"[17]
>
>One month after his desertion from the Navy, Essex's family persuaded him to return to Imperial Beach. Prior to doing so, Essex ensured he spoke to Lieutenant Hatcher, to whom he explained his reasons for his desertion. Hatcher's official notes state Essex informed him: "I don't want to have anything more to do with the Navy. It wouldn't be fair, not to you or the (dental) patients. The bad atmosphere would affect my work. The work is the only thing on this base I like." He then agreed to plead guilty to the charge of desertion.[18]
>
>At the subsequent hearing, Hatcher provided a vigorous defense of his protégé; praising his work ethic and stating the decision for his desertion had been influenced solely by ongoing racial discrimination. The judge conceded these factors were the cause and sentenced Essex to a lenient punishment of thirty days' restriction to base and forfeiture of $90 of his pay for two months.[18]

4. [Mark Essex - Black Panthers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Essex#Black_Panthers)
>Essex was given a general discharge from the Navy for general unsuitability on February 11, 1971, at the age of 21. This experience embittered Essex as he felt he had been unfairly stigmatized by the Navy, who had known only too well the discrimination he had endured. He initially traveled to Upper Manhattan, where he joined the New York branch of the Black Panthers.[19] Via his association with the New York Black Panthers, Essex became increasingly radicalized, and familiarized himself with the tactics of guerilla warfare.[20] He soon began referring to himself as "Mata",[n 1] and embraced the extremist content of the 1968 book Black Rage.[2][21]

2. [Red Lake shootings - Background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lake_shootings#Background)
>At the time of the shooting, by some accounts, Jeff Weise was living with his paternal grandfather, Daryl Lussier, Sr., a sergeant with the Red Lake Police Department, run by the Ojibwe (aka Chippewa) tribal government at the Red Lake Indian Reservation.\
>[...]\
>The reservation of the Red Lake Band of Ojibwe is in northwest Minnesota and is one of two nationally that are "closed"; only Ojibwe tribal members may live there and own land. Its residents suffer high rates of unemployment, violence, and suicide. Housing is poor, and many students do not finish high school.[3] Work opportunities are limited on the reservation, which has a population of more than 5,000. A study in 2004 found that a high proportion of students in high school had thought of suicide.[4]

3. [Red Lake shootings - Motives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lake_shootings#Motives)
>Weise expressed frustration about living in Red Lake, and felt his life was beyond his control. During these years, he got close to his grandfather, Daryl Lussier, Sr., who gave him a bedroom of his own. Lussier, Sr. lived with his companion Michele Sigana. Weise was said to have a good relationship with his grandfather.[2]
>
>Although Weise had been separated from his mother and stepfather for years by the time of their divorce in May 2004, he attempted suicide soon after, and again in June 2004. At that time, his aunts[1] and the Red Lake Medical Center arranged for Weise to be taken to a hospital for psychiatric treatment, where he stayed for three days.[2]
>
>Weise was prescribed Prozac as an anti-depressant, to be continued as treatment together with counseling. His doctor had increased his dosage a week before the shooting, to 60 mg a day of Prozac.[24] Weise's aunts, with whom he lived much of the time at Red Lake, said they had arranged for his medical care and were concerned about the increase in his dosage.[1] His actions reopened the debate about Prozac use among children and adolescents. In October 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had issued a warning about its use, but it is still the only anti-depressant that is FDA-approved for children.[1]
>
>Lorene Gurneau, a relative of Weise's paternal grandmother, said she and other family members thought Weise had never gotten over his father's suicide in 1997. In addition, his mother's car accident in 1999 had left her brain damaged and in a nursing home, which meant that he had effectively lost both parents by the age of ten.[2] When his mother's ex-husband refused to take custody of him, he felt like he didn't belong.[22]

4. [Red Lake shootings - Internet activites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lake_shootings#Internet_activities)
>Weise was discovered to have been quite active on the Internet. According to The Smoking Gun, Weise created two violent Flash animations for the flash website Newgrounds, using the alias "Regret". One animation, entitled "Target Practice", features a character who murders three people with a rifle, blows up a police car with a grenade, and kills a Klansman. The 30-second animation ends with the shooter putting the gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger. Weise had created another Flash animation, entitled "Clown", in which a clown kills a man by eating his head.[25]
>
>A LiveJournal account, apparently created by Weise, contained three entries posted between December 2004 and January 2005. The weblog was customized to be rendered in black and white. In his posts, Weise expressed his desire for change and salvation in his life.[21]
>
>Weise was a fan of the music genre known as horrorcore, and was particular a fan of rappers such as Mars, Jimmy Donn and Prozak.[26] He was known to frequent the Mars website.[citation needed] Jimmy Donn's song "Game Over" (which is a song about a school shooting) was said to be one of Weise's favorite songs, and Weise owned Jimmy Donn's album The Darker Side.[26]

He worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Cañada Flintridge. He met Sylvia Pardo, previously Sylvia Ortega, in 2004.[11]
>
>Police speculate that the motive of the attack was related to marital problems. Pardo's wife of one year had finalized their divorce the week prior to the attack.[8] However, Pardo held no criminal record and had no history of violence. He had been fired from his job as an electrical engineer at ITT Electronic Systems, Radar Systems in July.[3] There is some speculation that the divorce may have been caused by Pardo concealing a child from a previous relationship. This child was severely injured in a swimming pool accident several years prior. He did not support his child, nor did he pay any support to his ex-wife and her children.
>
>The couple wed in January 2006, but soon grew apart after their marriage, when Pardo refused to open a joint account with Sylvia; he also expected his wife to take care of her own three children with her own finances.
>
>In June 2008, divorce court had ordered Pardo to pay $1,785 a month in spousal support. During the divorce proceeding, Pardo had confided to a friend his wife was "taking him to the cleaners." In July, Pardo was fired for billing false hours and the court suspended the support payments due to job hardship.[16]
>
>Pardo was required to pay Sylvia $10,000 as part of the divorce settlement, according to court documents. Sylvia kept the wedding ring and the family dog. In a court declaration, Pardo complained that Sylvia was living with her parents, not paying rent, and had spent lavishly on a luxury car, gambling trips to Las Vegas, meals at fine restaurants, massages, and golf lessons.[17]

The couple occupied a cottage on his employer's property, for whom he had worked for nearly 11 years. He endured continuous financial difficulties but the marriage was happy until a few months prior to murders. The relationship deteriorated due to a young man coming to live at their house, an ex-serviceman who was recovering from wounds. When he talked to his wife about the matter, she told him that he was imagining things. His wife rejected him as husband and father. She would wash clothes of the family, including the young man‘s but left B.'s clothes for him to take care of, inciting jealousy. Sensing an increasing alienation of his children, he left the family home and moved to a house of his mother’s in The Meadows. He had arranged to visit the family on Father's Day, but his wife changed arrangements two days prior. On Sep. 5., B. bought drinks for his wife and sweets for children. When his wife eventually arrived she was was cold towards him and children unenthusiastic. She rejected his pleas for reconciliation, so he left the farm feeling blank. that night after hours of lying awake he hatched a plan to kill his wife, believing his wife was taking the family away from him. In his opinion she was unable care for them and the only way he could protect his children was by killing his wife. He intended to knock her unconscious then carry her outside and shoot her.

>An August 2016 memo by the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) described how, after taking a trip to the Philippines, Cassidy was detained by officers with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for a secondary inspection. They subsequently found books about terrorism in his possession, along with a memo book filled with notes about his hatred of the VTA. He was asked whether he had problems with anyone at his workplace, and he said he did not. According to a DHS official, Cassidy was detained by the officers partly because of red flags regarding sex tourism, but nothing relating to sex tourism was found, and the detention did not result in an arrest or apparently any follow-up action.[3][17][19]
>
>A CBP report on the encounter, released in July 2021, revealed Cassidy had harbored "dark thoughts about harming" two specific people, whose names were redacted from the report; it is unclear if they were connected to VTA or among the shooting victims. However, the CBP agents apparently prioritized sex tourism in their questioning of Cassidy, noting "sex friendly" hotels that were mentioned in his writings and his text messages with women in the Philippines.[43]
>
>San Jose officials later said the authorities were not informed of the detainment by federal officials.[19][44] John Sandweg, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said that there is no procedure for customs officials to alert local law enforcement agencies about a U.S. citizen detained as a safety threat. Santa Clara County district attorney Jeffrey F. Rosen said that, had his office been alerted about Cassidy's detainment, they would have had enough evidence to obtain a gun violence restraining order and seize his weapons.[15]

>Early in the evening of August 13, 1903, thirty-six-year-old Gilbert Twigg parked his wagon in an alley near the corner of Main Street and Ninth Avenue in Winfield, Kansas. A large crowd had gathered there for an outdoor music concert. Wearing a buckskin hunting jacket, he walked to Ninth and Main. The band was taking a break and the crowd milled around talking. About a block from the bandstand, Twinge dropped to one knee, shouted “I’m going to shoot you all,” and opened fire with a shotgun. 
>
>When he was done, nine people including Twigg himself, were dead. 
>
>Gilbert Twigg had become the first indiscriminate mass killer in US history. He had acted without apparent motive and had killed whomever was handy. It was something the country had never seen before and would not see again for almost fifty years. Like many of today’s serial shooters he had served in the Armed Forces and had bought his guns legally. He also left a manifesto of 650 words of rationalization that explained little. 
>
>“You should let this be a lesson to you in the future,” he wrote near its end.
>
>Army veteran
>
>Twigg had been born in Flintstone, Maryland in 1867 or 1868 and around 1888 had followed his uncle Argel to Kansas. There Twigg got a job as a miller and was said by people who knew him to be ambitious, intelligent, agreeable, and passably handsome, with “searing ice-blue eyes.” In those early days in Winfield, he worked, ran with a crowd of other young people, and courted a local woman, Jessie Hamilton, eventually proposing marriage and being accepted. But a short while after she accepted his proposal, for reasons that have never been clear, Hamilton changed her mind and broke off the engagement.
>
>Her decision twisted something inside Twigg. 
>
>“Those were the happiest days in my life,” he would write to a friend, Chance Wells, in 1902, “and it would have been much better for me if I had gotten married and settled down as you have done. I have no doubt but that you are very happy, while I am not.”
>
>In 1896, two years after the thwarted love affair, Twigg enlisted in the army. He served two hitches and at one point was promoted because of his marksmanship. He saw action fighting in the Philippines where he also became involved in some sort of dispute with an officer and a doctor, Lt. Myron C. Bowdish and Contract Surgeon O. W. Woods, the details of which were never made public. But whatever had happened continued to haunt Twigg. He was mustered out of the army in California as a sergeant with an “excellent” service record and lived briefly in Montana working as a miller before returning to Winfield in 1903.
>
>But things had changed, and Twigg was winding tighter.
>
>In Winfield, he was unable to get his old job back or find any other employment probably because of his deteriorating mental condition. He was also reported to have lost his job in Montana “under murky circumstances.” He spent his days lolling around Winfield parks or sequestered in his boardinghouse room muttering about the people in Montana and Kansas who he thought had mistreated him and were plotting against him. 
>
>Crazy Twigg
>
>Local boys began calling him “Crazy Twigg.” 
>
>Finally, on August 1, 1903, the twisting spring broke, and Twigg walked into the Winfield & Miller hardware store and bought a shotgun, an inexpensive .32 pistol, and more than 100 rounds of ammunition. He spent the next several days brushing up on the marksmanship he had learned in the Army. By August 13, he was ready. He piled his guns and ammunition into a tin express wagon and pulled it into the alley behind Ninth Avenue. Taking his shotgun, he began to walk to the Ninth and Main.
>
>Along the way, The Winfield Chroniclelater reported, he ran into a group of local boys and allegedly told them he had some “tall shooting to do” and told them to get out of the area.
>
>“I have no desire to hurt you,” the paper quoted him as saying.
>
>At Ninth Avenue, he stopped in front of the Milligan Shoe Store, in sight of the bandstand and about a block away from it, and began firing. The band, Canton’s Dozen, a military band, was resting on the stage looking over sheet music. Twigg’s first shot grazed a horse that bolted and his second passed through the shoulder of the band’s drummer, Re Oliver, and shattered Clyde Wagoner's horn. Havoc erupted as Twigg kept firing into the crowd. Three men were hit as they exited onto the street from the stairway leading to the Odd Fellows Hall next door to Milligan’s. A group of three women were hit, and a 15-year-old boy. Bodies littered the street in growing pools of blood as Twigg continued firing on the scattering crowd. Some were running holding wounded arms or limping on shattered legs. Others were down in the street and moaning alongside the buildings.
>
>Twigg had chosen the one evening of the week when the most people congregated, and “he chose the spot from which to fire with the skill of a general,” The Chroniclewrote. “He dropped on one knee at each fire, then retreated backward, while reloading, then dropped on his knee again and fired. These are the skirmish line tactics of the army and give a level `body line' to the volley. The employment of the tactics is due the terrible execution of his volleys. He remembered his training and `shot low.'”
>
>Twigg worked his way back to the alley and his wagon. His last two shots were fired as he leaned around the corner. He then grabbed his .32 pistol from the wagon and turned it on himself. The whole incident had lasted less than ten minutes. Eight people, plus Twigg, died either immediately or shortly after the attack. More than two-dozen others had been wounded.
>
>A rumor has persisted in Winfield for decades that Twigg did not shoot himself but was in fact killed by Winfield policeman George Nicholas, Winfield’s first and at that time only black policeman. “That rumor cast Nichols as a ready-made hero who ended the town’s most incomprehensible nightmare,” one historian wrote, “but [the town] was forced to deny his role because it was considered too dangerous for a black man to kill a white man, even justifiably.” 
>
>For the rest of his life, Nicholas continued to deny he had shot Twigg.
>
>The manifesto
>
>The morning after the shooting, local police searched Twigg’s room and found a letter blaming unspecified individuals and the world at large for his troubles. 
>
>"I would like to say to those who have interested themselves so much in my welfare (that seems to be the public in general),” he had written, “that I do not and most likely never will know the real cause of being treated in the manner in which I have been treated…You know you have `doped' me until I was forced to give up about a $100 a month position. You know that youdrove me from place to place and forced me to give up a neat little sum of my hard earned money to railroad companies, money that I went through the danger of war and diseases… You also know that you watched my mail and after finding out my friends and correspondents, you told them some kind of a story about me that caused everyone of them to drop me and turn me down cold.”
>
>Was the cause of this persecution, he wondered, “my girl affaire here some eight or nine years ago? “ 
>
>He also wrote that he regretted that “I did not settle this thing with Lieutenant Myron C. Bowdish and Contract surgeon O. W. Woods while I was a patient…in The Philippines. Then I could have gotten what was due me, and this thing would have been over long ago.”
>
>The Winfield Chroniclewas surprisingly sympathetic to the man who had shot up its town and killed eight of its residents.
>
>“Poor Twigg was not responsible for his insane acts. His disordered mind led him to the conclusion that the whole world was against him and he came back to the home of his boyhood to wreak vengeance and end it all,” it wrote on August 14, 1903.
>
>There would not be another such attack in the United States until 1949, forty-six years later, when Howard Unruh wandered through his Camden, N.J., neighborhood killing twelve people. But by 2017, attacks such as Twigg’s were occurring with frightening regularly—and killing far more than the eight people Twigg had killed. 
>
>“You should let this be a lesson to you in the future,” Twigg wrote in his manifesto, and he had indeed left a lesson for future generations.

>Carel Johannes Delport was born in 1956 and known by his nickname, "Kallie", and as a child suffered from meningitis.[7] Delport was declared unfit for military service for unknown reasons, and instead worked on the farm of his father, Marthiens Delport, earning 300 South African Rand a month. The farm was located in Allerkraal, a place outside of the city of Ladysmith. Delport reportedly had a history of mental illness and was twice charged with and acquitted of manslaughter after shooting two cattle thieves. His family had repeatedly asked his father to not allow him to own any firearms, but he declined their requests. Delport had 13 licensed firearms at the time of the shooting and was frequently asked by locals to participate in wildlife culling, because he was considered one of the best marksmen in the area.[8][9]

>According to an examination conducted after the shooting, Delport had an IQ of 78 and was suffering from borderline personality disorder.[10]

Instead, treatment using antidepressants was recommended to Auvinen's parents before any attempts to hospitalize him. Auvinen would go on to tell his online acquaintance, Vaula Kuuluvainen, that he would not be making it to military service the following months, leaving several other cryptic and homicidal messages with her the day before his attack.[4] Auvinen had irregularly taken SSRIs one year prior to his death.[16] Auvinen was frequently bullied at school[17] and school students reported changes in his behavior to a youth worker, saying he acted threateningly and remarked that they would die in "a white revolution".[4] One of his teachers described him as a militant radical who was interested in both far-right and far-left movements.[4][18] Auvinen had apparently been planning the shooting since at least early March 2006 before he met any of the YouTubers or online gamers who had later been blamed for the massacre.[4]

1. [Robert Worth Bingham - Later career](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Worth_Bingham#Later_career)
>Using the bequest from Flagler, Bingham purchased the Courier-Journal and Times in 1918.[18] He immediately clashed with long-time editor Henry Watterson, who soon retired. In the 1920s Bingham used the paper to push for farm cooperatives, improve education and support of the rural poor, and to challenge the state's Democratic Party bosses. In the latter endeavor he became an ally of U.S. Sen. J. C. W. Beckham, who had been governor in 1900-07. Bingham himself was, earlier in his career, discouraged from running for mayor due to the likelihood of heavy opposition from the likes of Democratic party boss John Whallen, and had bitterly described the unfairness of machine tactics he witnessed used against other candidates.[citation needed] He was among reform-minded Democrats who successfully backed Republican Augustus E. Willson of Louisville for governor in 1907.[citation needed]
>
>Bingham married his third wife, Aleen Lithgow Hilliard, in 1924. A strong financial backer of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Bingham was awarded with ambassadorship to Great Britain in 1933, and took up his post in May.[19] As ambassador, Bingham pushed for stronger ties between the United States and Great Britain,[20][21] and vocally opposed the rise of fascism and Nazism in the 1930s,[3] a time when Roosevelt would not because of political concerns at home.[22] On 7 November 1933 the Saudi-American Treaty was signed by Bingham on behalf of the United States and Hafiz Wahba on behalf of Saudi Arabia.[23] Bingham was succeeded in the post by Joseph P. Kennedy.

>Seriously ill, Bingham sailed back to the United States on November 19, 1937.[25] He died a month later, on December 18, 1937, from Hodgkin's lymphoma, at Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he had been operated on a few days before his death;[2][5] and was buried in Cave Hill Cemetery.[6]

2. [Barry Bingham Sr. - Family and career](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Bingham_Sr.#Family_and_career)
>George Barry Bingham Sr. was born on February 10, 1906 in Louisville, Kentucky.[1] Bingham's family owned a cluster of influential media properties – The Courier-Journal and The Louisville Times newspapers, plus WHAS Radio and WHAS Television. The papers had been purchased by his father, Col. Robert Worth Bingham, using proceeds from an inheritance left by his second wife, Mary Lily Kenan Flagler, herself the widow of railroad magnate Henry Flagler.
>
>Bingham attended Harvard University, then went into the family businesses. In 1931, he married Mary Caperton, a Radcliffe graduate. Bingham Sr. took the reins of the company in 1937; his elder brother Robert Worth Bingham Jr was considered incapable of taking control of the family business because of his alcoholism, and settled in England, where he married.[2] At the time, "The C-J" was little more than a Democratic Party organ, but Bingham built it into national prominence, thanks to reporting that was ambitious in scope for a newspaper in a city of Louisville's size. Throughout Bingham's tenure, the editorial voices of the C-J & Times was forthrightly liberal, especially for a fairly conservative (though predominantly Democratic at the time) state like Kentucky. The newspapers were recipients of six Pulitzer Prizes, including one for public service in 1967, plus multiple other awards during the Bingham years. The Courier-Journal became the commonwealth's dominant newspaper, a position it retains to this day. He also founded WHAS-TV, the city's second television station, and founded the WHAS Crusade for Children, a telethon broadcast on both the radio and television stations that today collects more than $6,000,000 each year for local children's charities. The family also owned Standard Gravure, a rotogravure printing company that printed the newspapers' Sunday magazine section, plus Sunday sections for other newspapers.
>
>In World War II, Bingham served as an officer in the United States Navy, and was twice awarded the Bronze Star. Bingham Sr. was given the rank of Commandeur, Légion d'honneur, by French government for service. In 1950, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[3] He was a Fulbright lecturer at Oxford University in 1955.
>
>On July 7, 1951, Bingham, along with Jane Darwell, was a guest on the CBS variety television series, Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town, when the program hosted Louisville and its music heritage.[4]
>
>In 1971, Bingham stepped down from day-to-day operations and handed over the operations of the company to his remaining son, Barry Bingham Jr. Bingham Sr. died at his home in Louisville on August 15, 1988, at age 82.[5] Bingham Jr. died on April 3, 2006.

4. [Standard Gravure shooting - Psychiatric history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Gravure_shooting#Psychiatric_history)
>Wesbecker had a long history of psychiatric illness and was treated for it in hospitals at least three times between 1978 and 1987. He was diagnosed as suffering from alternating episodes of deep depression and manic depression, was beset, among others, by confusion, anger and anxiety and made several attempts to commit suicide.[4][9] Hospital records also suggested that Wesbecker posed a threat to himself and others.[9]
>
>According to CBS's 60 Minutes, "In 1984, five years before he took Prozac, Wesbecker's medical records show that he had this conversation with a doctor. Have you ever felt like harming someone else? 'Yes,' Wesbecker said. Who? 'My foreman.' When? 'At work.' The same medical records show Wesbecker had already attempted suicide 12 to 15 times."[11]
>
>In the years prior to the shooting Wesbecker more than once threatened to "kill a bunch of people" or to bomb Standard Gravure and at one point considered hiring an assassin to kill several executives of the company. Apparently he even discussed these things with his wife before their divorce.[4] When he left Standard Gravure in August 1988 he told other workers that he would come back, wipe out the place and get even with the company and shortly before the shooting he told one of his aunts that he was upset about things at work and said they will get paid back, but as he said these things all the time, she didn't take the threat too seriously.[7]
>
>One of the employees at Standard Gravure said after the shooting: "This guy's been talking about this for a year. He's been talking about guns and Soldier of Fortune magazine. He's paranoid, and he thought everyone was after him."[12]
>
>Three days prior to the shooting, on September 11, Wesbecker told his psychiatrist that a foreman had forced Wesbecker to perform oral sex on him in front of his co-workers to get off the folder. In his notes, the psychiatrist wrote "Prozac?"[13]
>
>Wesbecker is buried in Louisville's Cave Hill Cemetery.[14]

5. [Standard Gravure shooting - Lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Gravure_shooting#Lawsuit)
>In August 1989, less than a month before the shooting, Wesbecker had started taking Prozac. The wounded and the families of those killed filed a lawsuit against the drug's manufacturer, Eli Lilly and Company, claiming that Wesbecker's use of Prozac contributed to his actions. The case went to jury trial. Midway through, defense testimony opened a door that would have allowed plaintiffs to make known to the jury Lilly's 1985 conviction for failing to report to the federal Food and Drug Administration adverse reactions to Oraflex, another Lilly drug. The plaintiffs and Lilly then negotiated an agreement, which they concealed from the trial judge, John W. Potter. The trial continued, and plaintiffs never introduced the precedent of Lilly's conduct with respect to Oraflex. The jury decided in Lilly's favor, and when plaintiffs failed to appeal, a suspecting Judge Potter uncovered the concealed agreement. With unanimous authorization from Kentucky's Supreme Court, he succeeded in amending the court record to show that the case was resolved by settlement rather than jury verdict.[15][16][17]

>[...]\
>Hole had been diagnosed with several behavioral disorders starting in the fourth grade and had undergone behavioral therapy sessions for them. His behavior in childhood deteriorated to a point where police had to be called to the home on at least two occasions, and where he could not attend school and graduate. As a teenager, he became suicidal and physically abusive towards his mother.[2] In March 2020, Hole's mother contacted the local authorities and warned them about her son's intent to die by suicide by cop and his purchase of a shotgun the day before, prompting an investigation to be opened. Police responded to the home and took him to a hospital. While being placed in handcuffs, an anxious Hole instructed the officers to turn off his computer, since he did not want anyone to see what was on it. An officer went upstairs to seize the shotgun and observed what he identified as white supremacist websites on Hole's computer in the process.[12][24][25] Hole was placed in an "immediate detention mental health temporary hold" by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, but he was released after less than two hours.[2][26] In April 2020, the FBI questioned Hole about the websites. The investigation was later closed due to insufficient evidence of any criminal violation or a racially motivated extremist ideology held by Hole, though the shotgun was not returned to him.[27][28]

The letter also contained complaints against the Food and Drug Administration, the legal profession, and a list of over 30 "criminals, rapists, racketeeres [sic], lobbyists", none of whom were among his actual victims.[6] Pettit & Martin occupied floors 33 (partial floor) and 34 through 36. The main reception floor was 35 and Ferri intended that floor as a target. His elevator stopped at the 34th floor because a secretary from that floor had pushed the up button for an elevator.

>Robert Arthur Hawkins was the 19-year-old perpetrator of the Westroads Mall shooting.[23] He was born at the RAF Lakenheath station in Suffolk, England, U.K., to American U.S. Air Force personnel parents Ronald Hawkins and Maribel "Molly" Rodriguez.[24] He was hospitalized at the age of four after persistent violent behavior in pre-school. He was diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder due to his chaotic homelife.[24] The day after he turned 14, he was sent to a mental health treatment center for threatening to kill his stepmother.[25] Four months later, he became a ward of the State of Nebraska, which lasted nearly four years until he was discharged completely due to his unwillingness to improve.[25]
>
>During his second hospitalization, he was diagnosed with an unspecified mood disorder and oppositional defiant disorder.[25] His treatments cost the state $265,000.[25] He was expelled from Fort Calhoun High School after trying to sell drugs to his classmates in 2005. He then attended Papillion-La Vista High School, and later dropped out in March 2006. He received a GED. In late 2006, he became estranged from his parents and chose to live with two friends and their mother in a home in the Quail Creek Neighborhood[19] of Bellevue, a suburb 10 miles (16 km) south of Omaha.[3] Debora Maruca-Kovac, the owner of the house in which Hawkins lived, described him as "troubled".[26] She also stated that he was depressed over being fired from his job at McDonald's, reportedly for stealing $17,[27] and over separating from his girlfriend two weeks prior to the incident because he cheated on her.[19][28] In the summer of 2007, Hawkins tried to enlist in the U.S. Army but was turned down on account of his mental health record.[29]

>Hawkins was ticketed on November 24, 2007, for suspicion of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and two alcohol charges,[30] one of which was underage possession of alcohol. He was due in court for an arraignment on December 19, 2007.[19] In late November, 2007, Hawkins threatened to kill a local teenager's family and burn her house down, because he thought she had stolen his CD player. The teen decided to press no charges because Hawkins was known for "shooting his mouth off".[31][32] Hawkins was also convicted as a juvenile of a felony drug conviction[33][34] while in foster care in Omaha.[34]

1. [Carl Robert Brown - Biography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Robert_Brown#Biography)
>Brown was born on November 26, 1930 in Chicago, Illinois. He joined the U.S. Navy and was honorably discharged in 1954. People later stated that Brown always kept a military bearing about himself and was quite militaristic. In 1955, he moved from Chicago to Florida,[1] where he graduated from the University of Miami in 1957 and in 1964 from East Carolina College in Greenville, North Carolina, earning a master's degree in education. After working briefly for Keyes Realty, he got a full-time job as history teacher at Hialeah Junior High School in 1962[1] and moonlighted at Miami-Dade Community College as an accounting instructor from 1964 to 1970.
>
>Brown was married twice and had three children. His first wife died and his second marriage failed, according to his second wife, Sylvia, because he refused to seek psychological help. As a consequence, his condition began to deteriorate, resulting in an increasingly disheveled and gaunt appearance, and, though once being a rather gregarious person, he began isolating himself more and more. A neighbor later described him looking "as if he were 80 years old". Reportedly, one of his daughters once tried to have him hospitalized, though as his admission had to be voluntary, her request was declined. Additionally, his career began to suffer. At Hialeah Junior High, Brown was an alleged bigot who hated everyone,[2][3] and was transferred to Drew Middle School, a school with a black majority, in 1981. There he taught American history until March 3, 1982, when he was relieved of his teaching duties for medical leave to treat his psychiatric problems.
>
>Though neighbors described Brown as a quiet, kind and helpful man, who was working hard to keep his duplex neat and clean, and praising him overall as a landlord, it was also said that he made a habit of walking into other people's yards early in the morning, waking them by yelling "United States!" and that during the night, shots were heard from his house. It was also reported that he once broke a window when firing a pellet gun, and picked grapefruit from a neighbor's tree wearing only his underwear. Apparently, he also collected aluminum cans.
>
>After a trip abroad, which he had taken shortly before the shooting, he came back in worse shape than before and stated that nothing in the United States stood for anything.[2][3]

2. [Carl Robert Brown - School problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Robert_Brown#School_problems)
>While Brown wrote in his application for a job as a teacher in 1961 that he "always enjoyed being with younger people" and felt that he "could benefit these younger people with his abilities", his work began to suffer as his psychological problems aggravated over the years. Being seen as a competent teacher for a long time, more and more complaints were filed against him as his condition worsened. Students began to refuse to sit in his class as he rambled incoherently about his personal problems and topics unrelated to his curriculum and conducted confusing conversations where he strung together completely unrelated things. Students would often take advantage of this by asking him a question that resulted in him talking for the rest of the period.[2] On one occasion, on May 5, 1977, Brown sent three girls to detention because they refused to sit in his class, as they were "sick and tired of hearing him talk." He was also known to be very prejudiced, to make threatening remarks, and to insult people of other races.
>
>During his time at Hialeah Junior High, Brown wrote a letter to the principal for "the enlightenment of the assistant principals," discussing the misbehavior of his students in rambling and poorly constructed sentences. "I don't read the students their rights as infants, you all do ... If you ever study business law, until a child is 18, the child can do just about anything the child desires to do and get away with the abuse.

>In the summer of 1981, Brown was transferred to Drew Middle School. There, on December 3, he had a dispute with two students, whom he accused of throwing books. During the argument, Brown described his sexual behavior with a girlfriend and chased the boys with a stapler. The school board's director of personnel control, Pat Gray, described this as "a classroom incident ... wherein Mr. Brown demonstrated a significant lack of adult judgment, an overtone of sexual fixation, and definitive aggression toward students." The school's principal wrote: "I found Mr. Brown to be incoherent and unable to grasp the severity of the situation at hand. I, also, fear for the safety of the students since during my conference with Mr. Brown he demonstrated no regret for his actions pointing to the fact that he is a 'man' and any man would have reacted in the same manner."
>
>Principal Octavio Visiedo wrote in his last evaluation of Brown: "I find Mr. Brown to be a negative force. Today I did a follow-up observation of Mr. Brown's second-period class and I continue to be alarmed about the potential for disaster in that class. As you can see, from today's observation, there is absolutely no discipline or control in that class and I am concerned for the safety of the students and also Mr. Brown." Further, he stated that Brown's class was in "total and complete chaos", with students talking constantly, wandering about at will, and leaving without permission.
>
>Brown reacted by writing a response in which he suggested that the principal "should seek the help" of the school board's employee assistance program, to which he himself was referred to in January 1982.
>
>Psychiatrist Dr. Robert A. Wainger examined Brown, saying that "Mr. Brown is suffering from rather severe anxiety associated with some paranoid and grandiose ideas" and that he also "demonstrates a probable thinking disorder". Though Wainger wrote that these symptoms would affect Brown's work, he was also of the opinion that he would be able to continue teaching if given psychotherapy and medication. Wainger also wrote that "although he may appear to be rather unusual and disorganized to the people around him, he (Brown) does not represent a danger to either."[4]
>
>After his examination, Brown wrote to Wainger: "I wish to thank you for the very interesting and informative meeting I experienced yesterday. Please stress blood analysis, heart cartograph [sic] and urine plus the other mental health features of your program." Finally, on March 3, Brown was relieved of his duties to seek psychiatric help and he agreed to seek further treatment from Wainger, though in a meeting with Pat Gray, Brown apparently said: "Wainger wants to study me, that's all. I can cure Dr. Wainger. I will treat him. I will change his seeds."[4][5]
>
>According to his former wife, Sylvia, Brown asked to return to work two days prior to the shooting, but his psychiatrist, who later stated that Brown showed no aggressiveness at that time, declined his request.[3][6]

>Mile Matić was born on 14 January 1956 in Derventa, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia. His father was an alcoholic. When Mile was 3 years old, his mother left the family. He lived in Doboj. His IQ was 162 and he was persistent in everything he did. He worked as a prison guard at the "Novi život" prison in Zenica, practiced karate, and quickly gained a black belt. He worked as a coach in the karate section, but was fired because he stole money from membership fees. He had a lot of girls. He was an amateur photographer. He photographed naked girls and filmed erotic scenes in which he was the main actor, but also blackmailed the girls, threatening to send photos to newspapers. Acquaintances said that he was calm, kind and a little narcissistic. He loved to read crime novels, Mercedes cars, and wanted young and beautiful girls.
>
>In March 1985, Matić met Smiljana Vasiljević. At that time, her boyfriend was in the army. She was a third-grade high school student. They were seeing each other, but at the end of the school year, she ended the relationship. However, Matić did not accept it. He watched her more and more often, waited for her near the school, and arranged for her parents to marry her. Realizing that neither marriage nor love with her will work, he openly threatened the girl and her parents, and then her boyfriend. He once told her friends, "She will not live to see the eighth of March."
>
>Matić often quarreled over the behavior of his sister's husband. He received dozens of complaints about threats and behavior at work. But no one paid attention to them and did not take them seriously.
>
>After two months of treatment at Zenica Psychiatric Hospital, Matić was released on 16 January 1985. He was discharged as a cured patient with a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. He was forbidden to come into contact with any weapons and was advised to report monthly to the Disability Commission. A similar opinion was expressed a few weeks later by a psychologist from the Sarajevo Institute of Public Health after a regular systematic examination of prison guards from Zenica. He stole these records and hid them. Even then, he had thoughts on how to get rid of people who "haunt him and who bother him."[1][2]

>
>He barricaded himself in the torpedo room, and for 20 hours repeatedly threatened to set a fire to detonate the torpedoes. While Vepr had no nuclear weapons and her reactor was shut down, the detonation of her torpedoes while she was tied up at the dock would have ruptured her reactor, creating what the regional director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Vladimir Prikhodko described as "a nuclear catastrophe ... a second Chernobyl."
>
>Attempts to persuade him to surrender failed. Kuzminykh's mother was flown to the naval base but was unable to persuade her son to give himself up. The situation remained a standoff until early on the morning of 12 September, when a special anti-terrorist commando unit of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) stormed the torpedo room. Early reports indicated that he had been killed by the FSB, but later reports indicated that he committed suicide. FSB officers regretted that "there was no way to preserve Alexander Kuzminykh's life."
>
>Kuzminykh was found fit when he was conscripted at a St. Petersburg enlistment office, even though he had suffered from a mental disorder and had been inhaling intoxicants. When Kuzminykh volunteered for the submarine service, he passed additional medical and psychiatric tests with high marks.

In 1974, Wesson began sexually abusing Solorio's eight-year-old daughter, Elizabeth.[9] Wesson married Elizabeth Solorio when she turned 14 and he was 27.[8] Four months later, she gave birth to her first child. Eventually the couple had 10 children together, including one infant who died.[8][10]

>One of Elizabeth's younger sisters left her own seven children with them, claiming to be unable to care for them due to a drug problem. Wesson never held a steady job; he lived off welfare and had his working adult children give him all their earnings.[11][12] In 1989, Wesson was convicted of welfare fraud and perjury.[13][14][15] The family often lived in run-down shacks, boats, and vacant houses.[8]

>Wesson was abusive toward his wife and children. He prevented Elizabeth from participating in the children's upbringing. He homeschooled the children and taught them from his own handwritten Bible that focused on Jesus Christ being a vampire. He told the children that he was God and had them refer to him as "Master" or "Lord". He taught the children to be prepared for Armageddon and said that the girls were destined to become Wesson's future wives. Wesson's school "curriculum" involved teaching girls oral sex as young as 8 or 9.[8] Their domestic responsibilities included washing Wesson's dreads and scratching his armpits and head.[8] The girls were not allowed to talk to their male siblings or their mother.[9] Both male and female children were physically abused.[9] Wesson raped two daughters and three nieces, beginning at age eight.[10] Each of the five girls became pregnant as a result.

>Jennifer San Marco was born in Brooklyn, New York. She went to Edward R. Murrow High School, later attending Brooklyn College. She then studied natural resources management at Rutgers University in New Jersey but did not graduate. In 1989 she came to California, where after studying she was hired as a guard at medium-security Chuckawalla Valley State Prison in Blythe. She quit two days before her probationary period ended. She never gave a reason for quitting but was described as a good worker.
>
>She held down a number of jobs, including a dispatcher for the Santa Barbara Police Department in the mid-1990s, a job for which she underwent a background check and psychological evaluation. She left the job after several months.[5] San Marco worked at a high school serving lunch before quitting in 2000. She eventually bought a condominium and went to work for the postal service as a clerk. She left on psychological disability following a 2003 incident in which she was pulled out from under a mail-sorting machine and had to be wheeled from her workplace by police in handcuffs.[1] She did return briefly, but was again removed from the building due to her erratic behavior and never returned. She was held at a Ventura mental hospital for three days in February 2001.
>
>San Marco's car broke down in Grants, New Mexico in 2004 and she decided to stay and reside there until the shooting. In the small town of Grants, she earned a reputation for strange behavior, which included speaking (or sometimes furiously shouting) to herself, ordering food at restaurants and bolting out the door before eating it, stripping naked in public (often in random parking lots), kneeling and praying in random places (often roadsides), talking to an imaginary friend, screaming death threats, yelling profane rap lyrics and making racist comments. She began getting tattoos and showed them to neighbor Jeannie Steen. When Steen didn't react, San Marco walked around her in a circle and spat on the ground.
>
>In July 2004, San Marco was denied a business license to begin publishing a periodical known as The Racist Press.[6] San Marco also at one point said she wanted to register a cat food business and was rejected because she lived in an unincorporated area of Cibola County. While being interviewed there, she would often talk to herself. After the rejection, she would frequently come to the office and stare at an employee named Sonya Salazar and ask to see her. Salazar was often told to hide when San Marco came to the office. San Marco once made a rude accusation that Salazar had slept with someone; authorities were called. She also came into contact with authorities after she appeared naked at a gas station. She was clothed when the officers arrived and ultimately let her off with a warning. These run-ins with authorities were frequent and she was once admonished for driving half-naked. San Marco sold her condominium and told people she was going to visit a sister on the East Coast.
>
>In November, a mental health clinic manager named Darlene Hayes said she saw San Marco alone in a post office parking lot kneeling at her car and talking to herself. When asked what she was doing, she replied, "They pray before they get in." She was supposedly talking about her sister and brother (whom she apparently believed were there). Hayes called the police and left several minutes later. According to a police lieutenant, there was no record of Hayes's call.
>
>A man who delivered propane gas to her and described her as polite noted that she always paid her bills on time, though he had noticed her talking to an "imaginary friend."[7]

>San Marco was apparently convinced that she was the target of a nefarious conspiracy centered at the Goleta postal facility, according to writings recovered from her home in New Mexico. A spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office conjectured that San Marco's paranoia and history of mental illness may have motivated her to commit the murders.[8] Racism may have also been an influence in the massacre, as six of the victims were minorities (three were black, one was Chinese-American, one was Hispanic and one was Filipino). She may have also murdered Graham for personal reasons. Graham had been in several arguments with San Marco. According to Graham's boyfriend, San Marco would often go outside and start singing loudly. Graham also complained to her brother that San Marco would come out and "rant and rave" in front of her building.[9]
>
>Among San Marco's writings were error-laden explanations of various religions and a confusing theory linking the U.S. government to "Son of Sam" killer David Berkowitz, the Ku Klux Klan and racist murders.[10] A diary with over 100 pages was also found full of meticulously tracked perceived slights and offenses she received from people. An auto body worker once said San Marco claimed that the postal service mistreated her, but that she never said anything violent or talked about murder (only that they had to "pay", which may indicate revenge as another possible motive).
>
>San Marco purchased the murder weapon and ammunition from two different pawn shops (one in Grants, the other in Gallup). She was able to do this with no problem, and she passed background checks. She also got a buzz cut hairstyle, which left her barely recognizable (and may have helped her in gaining entry into the building to commit the shooting).[11]

She also said he sometimes shot animals from his roof, which she had complained to police about, but they never responded to her complaint.[19] Another neighbor told the Associated Press that her family had lived near Ator for the past five months and were afraid of him due to his tendency to shoot rabbits in the nighttime and him banging on their door early one morning.[23]

>Mamoru Takuma was born on 23 November 1963 in Itami, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. As a child, he displayed unusual and anti-social behavior: at the age of three, he rode his tricycle towards the center of a highway, causing traffic jams, and habitually killed small animals by wrapping them in newspaper and lighting them on fire. From elementary school to junior high, Takuma was both a victim and a perpetrator of bullying. He expressed envy and jealousy for the "highly educated and high-income elite" from an early age. Takuma was both physically abused and neglected by his father, whom he contemplated stabbing to death in his sleep.
>
>In February 1979, Takuma enrolled in high school in Amagasaki, but dropped out in March 1981. He worked part-time at a gas station for several months until enlisting in the Japan Air Self Defense Force at the end of 1981, at age 18. However, Takuma was discharged in January 1983 for boarding and sleeping with a teenage runaway.[3] His relationship with his parents worsened following the discharge, and there were incidents in which his father beat him with stones.[4] Takuma in turn threatened to enlist the yakuza to "mess up" their lives.[5]
>
>In 1984, Takuma and his mother left the family home and purchased an apartment, leaving his oldest brother and father by themselves. They lived together for a year and a half, until his father came back for his wife.[6] In February 1999, Takuma's brother, facing bankruptcy, died by suicide in by slashing his neck with a knife. His father was hospitalized due to drunkenness after the incident, but according to Takuma in detention center, he said, "I wanted him to commit suicide like Tsutomu Miyazaki's father."[7] Takuma's mother had a lifelong struggle with mental illness, died at the end of 2016. His father died in April 2020, aged 88. The former Takuma residence in Itami was demolished in September 2020; the site is currently vacant.[8][circular reference]

2. [Mamoru Takuma - Criminal history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamoru_Takuma#Criminal_history)
>On 21 November 1984, Takuma raped a woman while collecting rent for a condominium management company. After the incident, believing the woman had filed a complaint to the police, he consulted a psychiatrist with his mother on 12 December and he complained about hearing hallucinations, "feeling that he's plunged into someone" and other complaints. The hospital initially diagnosed him with anxiety, but later stated it was schizophrenia in the medical certificate and in response to police inquiries.
>
>Takuma, who was placed in a closed ward, was dissatisfied with his care. On 4 January 1985, he jumped from the roof of the hospital's fifth floor in a suicide attempt, but instead fractured his mandible and maxilla. He later wrote to his mother that he was hospitalized to avoid being pursued by the police in a rape case and jumped off the fifth floor to "harass his parents".[9][circular reference] After being discharged from the hospital, Takuma decided to commit even more crimes for "revenge on the world." Later, the doctor in charge of Takuma's psychological examination stated that it may have strengthened his resentment towards society.[10][circular reference]
>
>In November 1986, Takuma was sentenced to three years in prison for the rape charge. While in prison, he jumped out of the hospital ward, explaining in a letter to his mother that he did it because she would not cooperate regarding his discharge. He demanded that his parents pay for his living expenses after release. His father refused, citing Takuma's lack of remorse, and told him that he would hand over the money he traded in for his personal belongings to disown him.[11][12][circular reference]
>
>After his release from prison in March 1989, Takuma moved to Ikeda and found work driving buses and trucks. His coworkers described him as a quiet and unremarkable man, but a bit of a loner who did not like dealing with customers.[6] Takuma testified in a later psychological examination that he caused two fatal car accidents, one when he was a dump truck driver and the other when he was a semi-trailer truck. In the first incident, while transporting industrial waste in the mountains, Takuma drove in front of another truck and suddenly pressed the brake pedal on a downward turn, causing a collision; all the passengers of the other truck died the next day. He lied about the cause of the crash and was not indicted on any charges. In the second incident, while driving near the Metropolitan Expressway, Takuma caused a motorist to fatally collide with a side wall. He immediately left the scene.[13][circular reference]
>
>In September 1993, Takuma was again arrested for rape. In 1998, he was fired after assaulting a bus passenger over the smell of her perfume. He found a new job as maintenance man at Itami Elementary School, six kilometers away from Ikeda. Later that year, Takuma was arrested on suspicion of assaulting his ex-wife. On 3 March 1999, Takuma dissolved temazepam, a tranquilizer, into the tea served in the teachers' room, sending four people to the hospital for three days. Regarding this incident he said, "I was ignored by the teachers and did not go well with my family, and I wanted to relieve my anger due to human relationships." Takuma was arrested, but was not criminally punished as was found "not responsible" due to mental illness.
>
>In November 1999, Takuma was arrested on suspicion of burglary, but the charges were dropped. He managed to get a job as a taxi driver in September 2000, but was fired the following month after he assaulted a hotel bellhop in Osaka, breaking his nose. In November 2000, Takuma got a job as a truck driver at a construction materials company in Ikeda, but was fired a few months later due to problems including a road rage incident. He was also kicked out of several apartments for, among other things, throwing his garbage out from the balcony. On 23 May 2001, Takuma voluntarily admitted himself into a psychiatric hospital for depression, but left the next day without treatment. He was also arrested for driving his car in reverse gear on the Hanshin Expressway but released after he was found mentally unfit.

The two men started drifting apart when Ruzicka went to college and Ratzmann joined the military. They stopped regularly communicating after that when Ruzicka moved to Janesville and then Michigan. "I was in complete shock," Ruzicka, 44, said of Ratzmann's actions. "It was really confusing and foreign to me." [...] Though the Ratzmann household was usually their hangout spot of choice, Ruzicka didn't remember much about Ratzmann's father. His dad was "distant" from his two sons and two daughters, he said. The rest of the family, he said, had a close bond. Ratzmann, at 44, was still living with his mother and one sister before the shootings. "I don't know if it's because he worked a lot or what," Ruzicka said of the elder Ratzmann's job at Allis-Chalmers. Ratzmann's mother and father divorced at some point in the four years following high school, Ruzicka said. During that time, while in the Coast Guard, Ratzmann was an electronic technician. That eventually became a career, as he had been a contracted electronic technician for GE Healthcare before Saturday. U.S. Coast Guard spokeswoman Julie Shifflet confirmed Ratzmann served from 1978 to 1982 and was honorably discharged.

A report to police said that he "was emotional" after being evicted from his parents' house.[35][46]

2. [Riverview Hospital (Coquitlam) - History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverview_Hospital_(Coquitlam)#History)
>In 1876, Royal Hospital in Victoria was converted to British Columbia's first facility to house mentally ill patients. Due to crowding, Royal Hospital was closed and the patients moved to the new Provincial Asylum for the Insane in 1878. Again facing problems of overcrowding at the turn of the century, in 1904 the provincial government purchased 1,000 acres (400 ha) in then-rural Coquitlam for the construction of Riverview Hospital and the adjacent Colony Farm lands. Construction of a temporary “Hospital for the Mind” was started at the Riverview property in 1909.
>
>In 1911 British Columbia's first Provincial Botanist, John Davidson, established an arboretum, nursery and a botanical garden on the hospital lands, often with the assistance of patients as there was a belief in the therapeutic value.[5] The botanical garden was moved to the new University of British Columbia in 1916, but the arboretum and nursery remained.[6]
>
>In 1913 a permanent Provincial mental hospital, administered by Dr. Henry Esson Young was opened, treating about 300 seriously mentally-ill male patients. The building was originally constructed to hold 480 patients, but by the end of the year it housed 919.[7] By this time, Colony Farm was producing over 700 tons of crops and 20,000 gallons of milk in a year, using mostly patient labour. In 1950, the Male Chronic building is renamed West Lawn, the Female Chronic building East Lawn and the Acute Psychopathic Unit becomes Centre Lawn. The hospital itself is now called the Provincial Mental Hospital, Essondale. In 1983 the West Lawn building was closed. In 1984, 141 ares of Riverview’s upper hillside were sold, subdivided and developed as the Riverview Heights subdivision with 250 single family homes and the remaining Riverview forest acquired by the city of Coquitlam.
>
>In 1924, the Acute Psychopathic Unit, later called Centre Lawn, opened. Several hospital staff lived at the remote site, and by 1927 this had grown into a small community called Essondale; including shops, a school, and Fire Hall.[citation needed]
>
>In 1930, the 675-bed Female Chronic Unit (later called East Lawn) opened due to overcrowding.[7] The first phase of what would eventually be called the Crease Clinic, the Veteran's Unit opened in 1934, with the second phase opened in 1949, giving Riverview its most iconic building. Finally in 1955, the Tuberculosis Unit (now called North Lawn) opened, marking the peak of patient residence.[8]
>
>By 1956 the hospital had reached 4,306 patients. In 1959 the charge of mental health services was transferred from the Provincial Secretary to the newly formed Department of Health Services. The transfer was followed by a transition from custodial care to the more active psychiatric care of patients.[9] In 1967 Dr. Davidson resigned as Deputy Minister and was replaced by Dr F.G. Tucker, a resident physician of Essondale (Riverview) from 1953 who, in 1959, became the Clinical Director of the Crease Clinic.[8]
>
>A steady decline in beds and facilities started in the 1960s and continued up to 2004 at which point there were only 800 beds. Some say that the reason for the decreasing number was initially due to the introduction of anti-psychotic medications and the development of psychiatric units in acute care hospitals as well as a move toward outpatient care.[9] As early as 1967 a decision had been made to downsize Riverview Hospital. The determination was first brought up officially on paper three years after the publication of the Mental Health Act of 1964 that intended to have mental health care be as readily available to the population as that of physical health. The two acts worked in conjunction so that by 1970 there were 17 Mental Health Centres in British Columbia, 12 of which had opened within the previous four years.[7]
>
>Decreases continued. In 1969 the Provincial Government appointed a committee to review the role of the Mental Health Branch of social services in British Columbia. The committee decided to further downsize Riverview in a stated plan to implement other community care centres. As further closures were being planned, legislation was also passed in 1969 that deemed Riverview an “open hospital” allowing private practitioners to send their patients to Riverview. A shift away from directors trained in psychiatry to administrative ones was marked. As services and beds at Riverview continuously decreased, while opening access of it through private practice, another official plan to entirely close Riverview Hospital was written in 1987: A Draft Plan to Replace Riverview Hospital.[10]
>
>Regional clinics began drawing patients from Riverview, and both advances in treatment and eventual cutbacks in funding resulted in fewer people receiving mental health care province-wide. In 1983, West Lawn closed and farming operations at Colony Farm were discontinued. In 1984, the provincial government sold 57 hectares (141 acres) of Riverview lands to Molnar Developments. Shortly afterward, this land was subdivided and became Riverview Heights, with about 250 single family homes. In 1985 an acute geriatric unit was opened at Riverview Hospital.[11]

5. [Highland Park parade shooting - Accused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Park_parade_shooting#Accused)
>Police records and people who knew Crimo indicate that Crimo came from a troubled household. When Crimo was two, his mother left him unattended on a hot August day inside a car with windows rolled up.[40] She pleaded guilty to child endangerment and was ordered to undergo an evaluation at a child advocacy center. Between 2009 and 2014, police officers visited the Crimos' home nearly 20 times, nine of which involved reports of domestic violence. In 2010, Crimo's father reported that his wife struck him with a screwdriver but later retracted the accusation. Officers recommended that the couple go through marriage counseling or separate. Crimo's parents no longer live together.[40]
>
>Law enforcement identified two prior encounters with Crimo: a 911 call in April 2019 reporting that he attempted to commit suicide and a September 2019 incident regarding alleged threats by Crimo to a family member.[58] According to law enforcement, mental health professionals handled the suicide matter.[55] In September 2019, police seized 16 knives, a dagger, and a sword from Crimo after a family member reported to the police that he planned to "kill everyone". Crimo's father said the weapons were his, however, and both parents denied Crimo had threatened anyone.[40] He was not charged with a crime at the time, but a “clear and present danger report” was filed with the Illinois State Police.[15][59] In December that year, Crimo applied for a Firearm Owner Identification card (FOID). It was sponsored by his father due to his young age.[15] On either occasion, Highland Park police could have invoked Illinois' red flag law, which would have allowed them to seek a restraining order preventing Crimo from buying guns for up to six months.[60] However, they did not pursue this option. Just four months later, in January 2020, Illinois State Police approved Crimo for a firearms permit, and he passed four background checks when buying firearms in 2020 and 2021.[60] When asked about why the "clear and present danger" report did not prevent Crimo from obtaining a FOID card, the Illinois State Police said that Crimo responded no when asked whether he would harm himself or others and "no one, including family, was willing to move forward on a complaint". Neither did they provide more information on threats or mental health that would have enabled further action by law enforcement.[61]
>
>Crimo's uncle, who lived with the accused, said that there had been "no warning signs" immediately before the shooting.[62]

>Charles was evidently the local agent of the Voice of Missions, a “religious” paper, published at Atlanta, as great bundles of that sheet were found. It is edited by one Bishop Turner, and seems to be the official organ of all haters of the white race. Its editorials are anarchistic in the extreme, and urge upon the negro that the sooner he realizes that he is as good as the white man the better it will be for him.

>In Atlanta, Henry McNeal Turner had particular reason to tread cart fully. Robert Charles's connection with Voice of Missions had brought much unwanted attention to Turner and his newspaper. Though he was generaly outspoken about racial affairs and mob violence, Turner had precious little to say about the events in New Orleans. Indeed, he addressed the controversy, only once in the pages of Voice of Missions, in a September editorial. "We desire to say, we have never seen Robert Charles; never spoke to him in our life, and have never written him a letter or received one from him," Turner in sisted. In spite of the testimony that Charles sold copies of the paper, Turner denied any association. "If he took our paper, he did no more than over ten thousand others do. We are not responsible, nor any other editor, for the deeds of men who read their paper." Turner insisted that his organ did not condone murder or advocate racial hatred. Though it promoted "the cause of religion, Missions and emigration, he claimed that Voice of Missions took no position on political or racial affairs, '06 Turner was clearly underselling himself and his newspaper. Voice of Missions was far more than a run-of-the- mill denominational monthly. It was a recognized vehicle for black nationalist sentiment and a powerful voice of protest. Over his long career, Turner never hesitated to speak his mind, no matter the risks or the controversy. In the wake of the violence in New Orleans, however, he was uncharacteristically circumspect.

3. [Henry McNeal Turner - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_McNeal_Turner)
>Henry McNeal Turner (February 1, 1834 – May 8, 1915) was an American minister, politician, and the 12th elected and consecrated bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME). After the American Civil War, he worked to establish new A.M.E. congregations among African Americans in Georgia.[1] Born free in South Carolina, Turner had learned to read and write and became a Methodist preacher. He joined the AME Church in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1858, where he became a minister. Founded by free blacks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the early 19th century, the A.M.E. Church was the first independent black denomination in the United States. Later Turner had pastorates in Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, DC.
>
>In 1863 during the American Civil War, Turner was appointed by the US Army as the first African-American chaplain in the United States Colored Troops. After the war, he was appointed to the Freedmen's Bureau in Georgia. He settled in Macon and was elected to the state legislature in 1868 during the Reconstruction era. An A.M.E. missionary, he also planted many AME churches in Georgia after the war. In 1880 he was elected as the first Southern bishop of the AME Church, after a fierce battle within the denomination because of its Northern roots.
>
>Angered by the Democrats' regaining power and instituting Jim Crow laws in the late nineteenth century South, Turner began to support black nationalism and emigration of blacks to the African continent. This movement had started before the Civil War under the American Colonization Society. Turner was the chief figure in the late nineteenth century to support such emigration to Liberia; most African-American leaders of the time were pushing for rights in the United States.

4. [Henry McNeal Turner - Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_McNeal_Turner#Civil_War)
>During the American Civil War, Turner organized one of the first regiments of black troops (Company B of the First United States Colored Troops), and was appointed as its chaplain. Turner urged both free-born blacks and "contrabands" to enlist. (The latter term refers to enslaved people who had escaped slavery and had their status classified as "unreturnable" because their former masters were engaged in war against the US government). Turner regularly preached to the men while they trained and reminded them that the "destiny of their race depended on their loyalty and courage". The regiment often marched to Turner's church to hear his patriotic speeches. In July 1863, the regiment had completed its formation and was preparing to leave for war. In November of that year, Turner was commissioned as chaplain, becoming the only black officer in the 1st USCT.[5]
>
>Turner discovered that the duties of a Union army chaplain in the Civil War were not well defined. Before the war, chaplains taught school at army posts. During the war, the duties expanded to include holding worship services and prayer meetings, visiting the sick and wounded in hospitals, and burying the dead. Each chaplain had to work out his role in his regiment, based on the expectations of the men in his care and his own talents. For Turner, this appointment enabled him to grow in influence among African Americans.[5]
>
>Turner was a chaplain for two years. Shortly after reporting for duty, he caught smallpox and spent months in the hospital recovering. He returned to his company in May 1864, just before they participated in their first armed conflict, the Battle of Wilson's Wharf on the James River. From May through December, his unit participated in the fighting around Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia. At the end of the year, they fought in the massive amphibious attack against Fort Fisher.
>
>Turner spent the spring of 1865 with his men as they joined Sherman's march through North Carolina. When the fighting ended, he was sent to Roanoke Island to help supervise a large settlement of freed slaves. Discharged in September, Turner was commissioned as chaplain of a different African-American regiment, which was assigned to the Freedmen's Bureau in Georgia. Shortly after arriving there, he resigned and left the army.[5]
>
>He turned his attention to politics, civil rights, black nationalism, and evangelizing for the A.M.E. Church among Southern freedmen.[5] Turner became a politician during the Reconstruction era, being elected to state government. He also was a powerful churchman, and a national race leader. While serving in the army, Turner had refined his thinking about the African race and its future in America.
>
>He gained wider attention nationally by two activities related to the war. First, he had written numerous letters from the battlefield which were published in newspapers, and gained him attention from readers and admirers in the North. These were his base for a lifetime of journalism. Second, in the first months after the war ended, he used his position as army chaplain to attract emancipated freedmen into the A.M.E. Church. Most former slaves had formerly belonged to white-dominated churches. The expansion of the independent AME Church in the South strongly influenced African-American life. Turner was the first of the 14 black chaplains to be appointed during the war.[5] Both the A.M.E. Church and the A.M.E. Zion Church, based in New York, also had numerous missionaries appealing to freedmen in the South.
>
>After the war, Turner was appointed by President Andrew Johnson to work with the Freedmen's Bureau in Georgia during Reconstruction. White clergy from the North and former military officers also led some Freedmen's Bureau operations.

>Knight's father was involved in the military and, as a result, Knight moved around frequently as a child. His lifelong dream was to defend Australia in a war. After a troubled high-school life at Westbourne Grammar School, Knight entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory on 13 January 1987, at the age of 18. While a military career had long been a dream, he lacked self-discipline and performed poorly at his studies and gained good results only in weapons expertise exercises.[4] Knight did not like authority and he hated the social hierarchy of the army which allowed people only a few months older than him to boss him around. One night, despite being confined to the base, Knight was involved in a fight and stabbing at a bar after being confronted by a senior.[4] Knight was consequently discharged and sent back to Melbourne 16 days prior to the massacre.

Knight moved often as a child, living in Melbourne and Puckapunyal, and also abroad in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. In early 1975, Knight's family settled in Laverton, Victoria, and he attended Laverton Primary School until the end of 1978. His parents divorced in 1980 when he was 12. He then attended Westbourne Grammar School, Fitzroy High School and later Melbourne High School, a selective secondary school with entry by academic examination. An entry written by students in the 1985 Melbourne High School yearbook says: Julian 'Swapo' Knight inherited the role of "cadet unit looney and chief political agitator". While at Westbourne he was known for his fascination with guns and the military, with strong interests in Nazi Germany and World War II. In 1986, he attended La Trobe University to study French, German history and politics. Knight has an IQ of 132, well above average.[2]

Knight entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon on 13 January 1987, at the age of 18. While a military career had long been a dream, he performed poorly at studies and gained good results only in weapons expertise exercises.

>With the outbreak of the Second World War, Rodger had a strong urge to chronicle the war. His photographs of the Blitz gained him a job as a war correspondent for Life magazine, based in the United States. Rodger covered the war in West Africa extensively and, towards the end of the war, followed the Allies' liberation of France, Belgium and Netherlands. He also covered the retreat of the British forces in Burma. He was probably the only British war reporter/photographer allowed to write a story on the Burma Road by travelling on it into China, with special permission from the Chinese military.[citation needed]

>Katō erased all contacts and communication records from his mobile phone just prior to the attack, the purpose of which he confessed was to avoid annoying those around him.[47] Katō later said that he posted the online messages hoping that police would take notice and stop him.[49] The weapons Katō used in the attack were reportedly purchased two days before at a military supply shop in Fukui, Fukui Prefecture, at about 12:40.[29] Katō spent about twenty minutes in the store, purchasing a telescopic baton and a pair of leather gloves, while the store's CCTV captured him conversing with the salesman and demonstrating stabbing motions.[50][51] Katō came to Akihabara the day before the attack to sell his personal computer and some software to raise money to rent the truck.[51][52]

>Tomohiro Katō (加藤 智大, Katō Tomohiro, 28 September 1982 – 26 July 2022) grew up in a suburban home in Aomori, Aomori Prefecture.[25] [26] His father was a top manager in a financial institution. Katō's grades were considered to be exceptional in elementary school and he was a top track athlete.[25] He entered Tsukuda Junior High School,[27] where he became president of the tennis club. However, Katō started to behave violently at home after enrolling at Aomori High School, an elite high school.[28][29] There, his class academic ranking fell to 300 (of 360 students) and failed entrance examinations for the prestigious Hokkaido University, eventually training as an auto mechanic at Nakanihon Automotive College.[25] Katō was hired as a temporary worker at an auto parts factory in central Shizuoka Prefecture, though he had been recently told that his job was to be cut at the end of June.[29]
>
>Katō reportedly did not get along well with his parents, and seldom returned home.[30][31] An interview with Katō's brother revealed that his parents had put immense pressure on both of them to perform and to excel in their studies,[30] ordering them to redo their homework to high standards in order to impress teachers in school, and recalled one incident when Katō was made to eat scraps of food from the floor.[31] Another neighbor recounted an incident where Katō's parents forced him to stand outside for hours in deep, cold snow during winter.[25] Previous online postings before his announcement of the attack contained sharp criticisms of his upbringing.[32] Deeply in debt and believing that his family had given up on him, Katō unsuccessfully attempted suicide in 2006 by ramming his car into a wall.[25]

>Guy Martel was born in Paris in 1944 during the Nazi occupation of France. His father Victor was a member of the garde mobile, and he had three sisters. Martel earned a degree in mathematics and chemistry, joined the military and was sent to Costa Rica, where he taught in San José. He rarely spoke about his time there, but related that he had seen horrible things and had to perform the duties of someone of higher rank who had been killed. In 1969 Martel had been taken hostage by guerrilleros for three weeks; he was flown back to France. upon his release. From then on Martel complained about being ill, saying he had caught a virus and suffered from intestinal and spinal pain.
>
>Martel accepted a position as a natural sciences teacher at Henri Matisse college in Issy-les-Moulineaux. However, in 1972, after less than two years, he was forced to quit due to a nervous disorder and was put on a long term disability leave. Afterwards he had briefly sent to mental institutions three times – once in Paris, and twice in Brittany – and was accorded a degree of disability of 80%. In 1975, Martel was granted a disability pension and moved in with his parents in Baguer-Morvan. When his mother died from a heart attack in 1976, his condition began to deteriorate and he saw hostility everywhere. Due to a growing discord between him and his father, Martel decided to live alone and bought a house in Dol-de-Bretagne in 1979.[1]
>
>In Dol-de-Bretagne, Martel rarely left his home except to lie in his garden or to play tennis at a local sports hall. He also ate lunch every day at a home for elderly people. Besides his father; his uncle Charles; and his physician, a Dr Launay, Martel had no visitors and consequently was known as "monsieur tout seul" (Mr. All Alone) throughout the village. Martel generally was quickly fatigued and complained a lot about noise, especially those made by children, whom he called loud and annoying. One day, when a child pressed Martel's doorbell and ran away, he came out angrily, shouting: "If you do that again, I will kill you!"[2]

>Richard Farley was born July 25, 1948 in Texas. He was the oldest of six children. His father was in the military, therefore the family frequently relocated, and eventually settled in California. He graduated from high school in 1966 and attended Santa Rosa Junior College. Farley then joined the United States Navy in 1967 where he stayed for ten years. After his discharge in 1977, Farley began working as a software technician at ESL Inc., a defense contractor in Sunnyvale, California.[2]

2. [ESL Incorporated - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESL_Incorporated)
>ESL Incorporated, or Electromagnetic Systems Laboratory, was a subsidiary of TRW, a high technology firm in the United States that was engaged in software design, systems analysis and hardware development for the strategic reconnaissance marketplace. Founded in January 1964 in Palo Alto, California, the company was initially entirely privately capitalized by its employees. One of the company founders and original chief executive was William J. Perry, who eventually became United States Secretary of Defense under President Bill Clinton. Another company founder was Joe Edwin Armstrong.[1] ESL was a leader in developing strategic signal processing systems and a prominent supplier of tactical reconnaissance and direction-finding systems to the U. S. military. These systems provided integrated real-time intelligence.
>
>Most of TRW—including ESL—was acquired by the Northrop Grumman Corporation in December 2002.
>
>ESL primarily supplied domestic intelligence agencies, NASA and the U.S. military, but had certain direct relations with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and also provided some services for a variety of state agencies. Principal historic areas of competence are: (a) reconnaissance systems; (b) data communications systems (including advanced sonar and laser light scattering); (c) phased array radar surveillance systems; (d) advanced data processing systems; and (e) environmental systems. The company employed a large technical staff, most of them holding advanced academic degrees.

3. [Richard Farley - Stalking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Farley#Stalking)
>In April 1984, 35-year-old Richard Farley met 22-year-old Laura Black, who also worked at ESL Inc. Farley described himself as immediately smitten and later said that he instantly "fell in love" with Black. Farley began leaving gifts, including letters and homemade baked goods, on Laura Black's desk and asked her out numerous times.[2] Black repeatedly refused the invitations and later said in an interview that she "...tried really to ignore him but to be cordial".[3] Despite her refusals, Farley persisted; he began calling her desk every few hours as well as showing up at Black's aerobics class. By providing false information to the ESL HR department through pretexting, Farley was able to obtain Black's home address and home phone number. Farley was also known to have befriended the custodial department in an attempt to copy keys to Black's desk so he could rifle through her files to gain an insight into her life. He was also known to have pried through confidential personnel files of Black through false pretenses.
>
>During this time, Farley was sending one or two letters to Black a week. Though there were periods of time during which the letters would cease, in total Farley sent about two hundred letters over a period of four years, with the final letter sent from his prison cell after his rampage at ESL. Black moved four times during those four years, but Farley was able to obtain her address every time. Farley doctored photos of him and Black being together and mailed them to her.[4]
>
>In fall of 1985, Black asked the Human Resources Department at ESL for help. ESL ordered Farley to attend psychological counseling sessions, and despite attending these sessions, his harassment of Black continued. By spring of 1986, Farley was threatening fellow ESL employees. Because of his poor performance, his employment with ESL was terminated in May 1986.[5][6] He had been working for ESL for nine years and spent several months stalking Black full-time, then found work at a rival company, Covalent Systems Corporation in Sunnyvale.[7]

His parents divorced when he was nine years old and the divorce is described as having been calm and sensible. Flink chose to stay with his father in the family house while his mother moved to an apartment just a couple of hundred meters from the house.

Five different mental health professionals diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia.[9] He presented a history of mental illness, as he had tried to commit suicide and had been hospitalized and treated with electroconvulsive therapy in the past. He was committed to the California state mental hospital system, beginning at Atascadero State Hospital. He was then transferred and held at Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino. In 2016, he was transferred to the less secure Napa State Hospital. The families of Allaway's victims protested his transfer.[4]

>He was found to have injured a co-worker at a Michigan plant. A short time before the shooting rampage, he had threatened his wife with a knife and raped her.[3] Allaway's apparent motive was that he had delusions that pornographers were forcing his wife to appear in movies. The couple had separated over Memorial Day Weekend 1976 after a blow-up. His wife had filed for divorce shortly before Allaway attacked co-workers at the university.

Oleg Naumov was born in 1978, and was serving as a private in the Russian Ground Forces, having been conscripted into the military a year before the attack. He was stationed at a military base located in Pobedino, a village on the island of Sakhalin in the Russian Far East region.

[United States Youth Council - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Youth_Council)
>The United States Youth Council (USYC) was a nonprofit coalition of organizations which served youth and young adults in the United States. It was founded in 1945 by the National Social Welfare Assembly as that organization's youth division, but became independent in the early 1960s. In 1967, The New York Times revealed that the USYC had received more than 90 percent of its funds from the Central Intelligence Agency, leading many of the organization's largest members to quit. USYC continued to receive funding from the United States government before disbanding in 1986.

[United States Youth Council - Founding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Youth_Council#Founding)
>The USYC was founded in 1945 by the National Social Welfare Assembly, a coalition of social service agencies. Originally named the "Young Adult Council of the NSWA" (YAC), the organization had 16 members, including American Youth Hostels, Camp Fire Girls, 4-H, American Unitarian Youth, National Catholic Welfare Conference, National Students Assembly, YMCA and YWCA.[1]
>
>YAC's structure was staff-driven. It was led by an executive director who was a full-time staff members of NSWA, and most of its funding came from the NSWA as well. International travel was often funded by outside sources, such as the Rockefeller Foundation. YAC nevertheless maintained a chairman who, under the organization's bylaws, was required to be under the age of 30. The organization also maintained council of representatives from each participating member. As late as 1967, 60 percent of WAY's budget was financed by contributions from the foundation.[1]

[United States Youth Council - History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Youth_Council#History)
>In 1948, the World Assembly of Youth (WAY) was formed as a non-communist alternative to the World Federation of Democratic Youth.[2] WAY's inaugural convention was in August 1948. Prior to the meeting, the Young Adult Council ejected most of its members with ties to political parties or trade unions. The YAC played a significant role in drafting the WAY constitution and electing its first leaders, and became the U.S. affiliate of WAY.[1]
>
>WAY struggled financially in its early years. YAC provided most of WAY's funding through a grant from the Foundation for Youth and Student Affairs, a front organization established and funded by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). YAC provided $301,000 to WAY from the foundation. Although WAY was troubled by its dependence on the Americans (and one American donor), the organization had no choice but to accept the money. YAC's executive director, Bernice Bridges, knew that the source of the funds was the U.S. government. But this fact did not appear to concern her or her superiors in NSWA.[1]
>
>In 1963, YAC changed its name to the United States Youth Council.[1]
>
>USYC, too, continued its reliance on CIA money. At the height of its strength in the middle to late 1960s, the U.S. Youth Council had 37 member organizations, including the College Democrats of America, Collegiate Council for the United Nations, National Federation of Catholic Youth, National Student Association, Students for a Democratic Society, YMCA, Young Christian Workers, Young Democrats of America, Young Republicans, and the Youth Division of the NAACP.[3] At various times, it worked closely with the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the A. Philip Randolph Institute.
>
>In 1967, The New York Times revealed that the CIA had supplied 90 percent of the organization's funds, and was surreptitiously controlling its agenda.[3][4] Presidents and vice-presidents of USYC were aware of the source of the funds: They were given a top-secret security clearance by the CIA and required to sign a 20-year confidentiality agreement to keep the intelligence agency's involvement a secret.[1] The revelations caused a number of the U.S. Youth Council's largest members to withdraw.[5]
>
>USYC's council conducted an investigation which was largely inconclusive. The study found that some officers had clearly signed secrecy agreements, but the council was unable to prove that all presidents and vice-presidents had done so. The National Student Association and the University Christian Movement claimed the study was a whitewash, and withdrew from the USYC. In response, the USYC resolved not to accept any more funding from the Foundation for Youth and Student Affairs.[1]
>
>The loss of government financing nearly bankrupted the USYC. In December 1967, the United States Department of State stepped in to provide funding to keep the organization afloat. In time, financing was shifted to the United States Information Agency (USIA), which continued to fund its work openly.[6]
>
>The ongoing revelations of CIA funding led USYC and NSWA to sever their relationship in 1969.[1]
>
>USYC withdrew from WAY in 1976 after several years of tension over policies, programs, funding and anti-American feeling by delegates from under-developed countries. USYC became increasingly conservative and isolated within the American and international youth movement for the remainder of the 1970s and through the 1980s. In some respects, this enabled the organization to continue to receive funding from the Reagan administration.[1]
>
>In 1981, the United Nations announced that 1985 would be an International Youth Year (IYY). USYC attempted to take the lead in planning for U.S. participation in the IYY. Competition with a rival body, the U.S. Committee on International Youth Year, led to a congressional investigation. In 1985, Congress passed the Zorinsky amendment (U.S.C. 1461-1a), which barred programs funded by the USIA from operating domestically or conducting propaganda campaigns against domestic audiences. The law also required the IYY committees to be representative and open to all youth organizations. USYC refused to open the executive positions on its IYY committee to other groups, and American participation in the IYY collapsed.[1][6]
>
>USIA withdrew its funding for the USYC in 1986, and the organization folded.[1]

>Stone was enlisted in 2002 as a reservist in the United States Marine Corps, mainly as a meteorologist.[1] He was assigned to the 3rd Battalion 14th Marines, a reserve artillery battalion in Philadelphia.[26] Stone had one deployment to Iraq that started on April 17, 2008, and ended on July 2 of the same year. He left service sometime later that year, although he remained on individual ready reserve until 2011. Stone left with the rank of sergeant, according to a Marine spokesperson.[13][27] Stone was reportedly being treated for unspecified combat-related physical injuries. On December 8, he met a psychiatrist at a Veterans Affairs medical center, and was found to have no suicidal or homicidal ideation.[3][28] He had pleaded guilty in November 2013 to an April 28 vehicular crash caused by drunken driving. As part of his sentence, he was participating in a county rehabilitation program for veterans.[26][29] Stone had previously had two other drunken-driving incidents, one that occurred in 2001 and the other in 2004.[5]

Mr. Benoist developed psychiatric problems and accumulated a police record soon after he left the Marine Corps after 33 days as a recruit. A Municipal Court judge here, William. H.

Reportedly, Popper was punished for inappropriate use of weapons during his military service, where he had attempted to commit suicide, for which he was imprisoned. 

2. [Ami Popper - Murders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ami_Popper#Murders)
>On May 20, 1990, Popper, a dishonorably-discharged soldier, put on Israel Defense Forces uniform trousers, stolen from his brother, an active duty soldier.[3] He also stole his brother's assault rifle and five ammunition clips.[4] At around 6:15 a.m., he spotted a group of Palestinian workers from the Gaza Strip at a bus stop in the city of Rishon Lezion, waiting to be picked up for laboring jobs in Israel. Suspecting they were Arab, he demanded to see their identity cards. After confirming they were Arabs he ordered them to line up in three rows, on their knees. He then opened fire with an M16, and left the scene in his car. 7 Palestinians were killed immediately, while a further 10/11 were wounded badly. Palestinian reports state that, on arriving at the scene, Israeli police proceeded to beat up the surviving Palestinians.[2][5][6] Within an hour, he was arrested.
>
>In clashes that arose as Palestinians throughout the territories protested, Israeli security forces, while suppressing the protests, killed a further seven people, including a 14-year-old boy[2] After a week of clashes, 19 Palestinians were killed,[2] while around 700 more suffered injuries. Yitzhak Shamir dismissed his act as of no political significance since Popper was "deranged". The court found him sane and fit to stand trial.[7]
>
>Popper first told police that his attacks were a reaction to the First Intifada, later claiming to have been distraught because his girlfriend had decided to leave him. He also stated that he had been raped by an Arab when he was 13 and had committed these killings out of shame and a desire for revenge.[8] Two days later rabbi Meir Kahane held a celebration of his deed in Rishon LeZion.[9]

>Born in Honolulu in 1959, Byran Koji Uyesugi grew up in the Nuuanu neighborhood. While attending Roosevelt High School, Uyesugi was a member of the school's Army JROTC chapter and the school's rifle team. Classmates remembered him as a quiet student who never got into trouble. According to his brother Dennis, Uyesugi crashed their father's car and hit his head on the windshield shortly after graduating high school in 1977; he was never the same afterwards.[3]
>
>Uyesugi had been employed by Xerox as a technician since 1984. Among his hobbies was raising and breeding goldfish and koi, which he would sell to local pet stores. He had an extensive collection of firearms. At the time of the murders he had as many as 25 guns registered in his name, dating to 1982. Police also took eleven handguns, five rifles and two shotguns from Uyesugi's father.[4]
>
>According to testimony from Uyesugi's father, Hiroyuki, Uyesugi was normal until he started working for Xerox in 1984. In 1988, Byran started to complain that he had a poking sensation in his head.[5][6][7]
>
>After being transferred to another workgroup, Uyesugi began making unfounded accusations of harassment and product tampering against fellow repairmen. They had difficulty dealing with him. Former co-workers who knew him reported the other members of his team allegedly ostracized him, making him feel isolated and withdrawn. Uyesugi reportedly made threats against other co-workers' lives. In 1993, he was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation and anger management courses after he kicked in and damaged an elevator door. Uyesugi was arrested for third-degree criminal property damage.[4] Co-workers told Dr. Michael Welner, chairman of the Forensic Panel and the forensic psychiatrist who interviewed Uyesugi prior to trial, that as early as 1995, Uyesugi was openly talking of carrying out a mass shooting at the workplace were he to be fired.[4] He complained that his co-workers were engaged in patterns of harassment, backstabbing behavior, and spreading of rumors.[8]
>
>In the period leading up to the shootings, Xerox management had become increasingly committed to phasing out the type of photocopier that Uyesugi serviced. He resisted learning the replacement machine, fearing that he could not keep up with its technical demands. After working around his refusal to train on the new machine, Uyesugi's manager insisted on November 1, 1999, that he would begin training the next day. In his interview with Dr. Michael Welner, who examined Uyesugi when the defendant brought an insanity defense, Uyesugi said he had believed that if he refused to take the training, management would fire him. He told Dr. Welner, "I decided to give them a reason to fire me."[8]

2. [Duracell - Origins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duracell#Origins)
>Duracell originated via the partnership of scientist Samuel Ruben and businessman Philip Rogers Mallory, who met during the 1920s. The P. R. Mallory Company of Burlington, Massachusetts, United States, relocated its headquarters to Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1924. The company produced mercury batteries for military equipment,[4] trumping the carbon-zinc batteries used then in virtually all applications. In 1956, P. R. Mallory & Co. acquired General Dry Batteries, Inc. (GDB) with headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio. GDB was then the third-largest U. S. manufacturer of zinc-carbon batteries and had made mercury batteries under license from P. R. Mallory during World War II and after the war until its acquisition in 1956.[5] During the 1950s, Kodak introduced cameras with a flash. The design required a new zinc-carbon cell size, and size AAA was developed.[4]
>
>In 1964, the term "Duracell" was introduced as a brand, from "durable cell". Until 1980, the batteries also bore the Mallory brand.

Branches start to open in the US; the first one apparently opens in Tucson, Arizona, where al-Qaeda has a sleeper cell (see 1986). But around 1986, Khaled Abu el-Dahab, the right hand man of double agent Ali Mohamed, informally founds the branch in Brooklyn, New York, and it soon becomes the most important US branch. [NEW YORK TIMES, 10/22/1998; BURR AND COLLINS, 2006, PP. 269-270] On December 29, 1987, three men, Mustafa Shalabi, Fawaz Damra, and Ali Shinawy, formally file papers incorporating Al-Kifah, which is called the Al-Kifah Refugee Center.

Shalabi, a naturalized citizen from Egypt, runs the office with two assistants: Mahmud Abouhalima, who will later be convicted for a role in bombing the World Trade Center in 1993 (see February 26, 1993), and El Sayyid Nosair, who will assassinate a Jewish leader in New York in 1990 (see November 5, 1990). [NEW YORK TIMES, 4/11/1993; NEWSWEEK, 10/1/2001; CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER, 11/4/2001] Jamal al-Fadl, a founding member of al-Qaeda and future FBI informant (see June 1996-April 1997), also works at the Al-Kifah Refugee Center in its early days. [MILLER, STONE, AND MITCHELL, 2002, PP. 155] The Brooklyn office recruits Arab immigrants and Arab-Americans to go fight in Afghanistan, even after the Soviets withdraw in early 1989. As many as 200 are sent there from the office. Before they go, the office arranges training in the use of rifles, assault weapons, and handguns, and then helps them with visas, plane tickets, and contacts. They are generally sent to the MAK/Al-Kifah office in Peshawar, Pakistan, and then connected to either the radical Afghan faction led by Abdul Rasul Sayyaf or the equally radical one led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. [NEW YORK TIMES, 4/11/1993] The CIA has some murky connection to Al-Kifah that has yet to be fully explained. Newsweek will later say the Brooklyn office “doubled as a recruiting post for the CIA seeking to steer fresh troops to the mujaheddin” fighting in Afghanistan. At the same time, the Brooklyn office is where “veterans of [the Afghan war arrived] in the United States—many with passports arranged by the CIA.” [NEWSWEEK, 10/1/2001] Robert I. Friedman, writing for New York magazine, will comment that the Brooklyn office was a refuge for ex- and future mujaheddin, “But the highlight for the center’s regulars were the inspirational jihad lecture series, featuring CIA-sponsored speakers.… One week on Atlantic Avenue, it might be a CIA-trained Afghan rebel traveling on a CIA-issued visa; the next, it might be a clean-cut Arabic-speaking Green Beret, who would lecture about the importance of being part of the mujaheddin, or ‘warriors of the Lord.’ The more popular lectures were held upstairs in the roomier Al-Farouq Mosque; such was the case in 1990 when Sheikh [Omar] Abdul-Rahman, traveling on a CIA-supported visa, came to town.” One frequent instructor is double agent Ali Mohamed, who is in the US Special Forces at the time (see 1987-1989). Bin Laden’s mentor Azzam frequently visits and lectures in the area. In 1988, he tells “a rapt crowd of several hundred in Jersey City, ‘Blood and martyrdom are the only way to create a Muslim society.… However, humanity won’t allow us to achieve this objective, because all humanity is the enemy of every Muslim.’” [NEW YORK MAGAZINE, 3/17/1995] Ayman Al-Zawahiri, future Al-Qaeda second in command, makes a recruiting trip to the office in 1989 (see Spring 1993). [NEW YORKER, 9/9/2002] The Brooklyn office also raises a considerable amount of money for MAK/Al-Kifah back in Pakistan. The Independent will later call the office “a place of pivotal importance to Operation Cyclone, the American effort to support the mujaheddin. The Al-Kifah [Refugee Center was] raising funds and, crucially, providing recruits for the struggle, with active American assistance.” [INDEPENDENT, 11/1/1998] Abdul-Rahman, better known as the “Blind Sheikh,” is closely linked to bin Laden. In 1990, he moves to New York on another CIA-supported visa (see July 1990) and soon dominates the Al-Kifah Refugee Center. Shalabi has a falling out with him over how to spend the money they raise and he is killed in mysterious circumstances in early 1991, completing Abdul-Rahman’s take over. Now, both the Brooklyn and Pakistan ends of the Al-Kifah/MAK network are firmly controlled by bin Laden and his close associates. In 1998, the US government will say that al-Qaeda’s “connection to the United States evolved from the Al-Kifah Refugee Center.” Yet there is no sign that the CIA stops its relationship with the Brooklyn office before it closes down shortly after the 1993 WTC bombing.

>The Boston Herald reports that an internal CIA report has concluded that the agency is “partially culpable” for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing (see February 26, 1993) because it helped train and support some of the bombers. One source with knowledge of the report says, “It was determined that a significant amount of blowback appeared to have occurred.” A US intelligence source claims the CIA gave at least $1 billion to forces in Afghanistan connected to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. More than a half-dozen of the WTC bombers belonged to this faction, and some of the CIA money paid for their training. The source says, “By giving these people the funding that we did, a situation was created in which it could be safely argued that we bombed the World Trade Center.” Those connected to the bombing who went to Afghanistan include Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman, Clement Rodney Hampton-el, Siddig Siddig Ali, Ahmed Ajaj, and Mahmud Abouhalima. [BOSTON HERALD, 1/24/1994] Additionally, Ramzi Yousef trained in Afghanistan near the end of the Afghan war, and there are claims he was recruited by the CIA (see Late 1980s). “Intelligence sources say the CIA used the Al-Kifah Refugee Center in Brooklyn—founded to support the Afghani rebels fighting Soviet occupation—to funnel aid to Hekmatyar, setting the stage for terrorists here to acquire the money, guns and training needed to later attack the Trade Center. CIA support also made it easier for alleged terrorist leaders to enter the country.” [BOSTON HERALD, 1/24/1994] It will later be alleged that the CIA repeatedly blocked investigations relating to Al-Kifah, which was al-Qaeda’s operational base in the US (see Late 1980s and After).

3. [Late 1980s: Ramzi Yousef Recruited by CIA?](http://web.archive.org/web/20210629020000/http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a1980syousefcia#a1980syousefcia)
>Al-Qaeda bomber Ramzi Yousef is said to be recruited by the CIA, though details are not known. Author Richard Labeviere reported without elaboration in a 1999 book, “A classified FBI file indicates that [Yousef] was recruited by the local branch of the CIA.” [LABEVIERE, 1999, PP. 220-221] In 1995, Newsday will report, “FBI officials also are considering a probe of whether the CIA had any relationship with Yousef, who fought with the CIA-financed mujaheddin in Afghanistan in the 1980s.” [NEWSDAY, 4/16/1995] But there appears to be no further reporting on whether such a probe was conducted. Yousef is believed to have masterminded a series of bombings in the early 1990s, including the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the planned Bojinka attack, before being captured in 1995 (see February 7, 1995). If Yousef was recruited by the CIA, it may have been in the late 1980s when the CIA recruited and trained thousands of people around the world to fight in Afghanistan (see 1986-1992). In the late 1980s, Yousef was studying engineering at a Wales college, but he’d also joined the Muslim Brotherhood while there. During a break from school in 1988, he went to one of bin Laden’s training camps in Afghanistan and spent several months honing his bomb-making skills. [MILLER, STONE, AND MITCHELL, 2002, PP. 78]

4. [1988-Spring 1995: KSM’s Brother Works for Charity Allegedly Connected to CIA](http://web.archive.org/web/20210629001538/http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a93zahidmercy#a93zahidmercy)
>Zahid Shaikh Mohammed, the brother of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (KSM), works as the head of the Pakistani branch of the charity Mercy International. A book published in 1999 will allege that this charity, based in the US and Switzerland, was used by the CIA to funnel money to Muslim militants fighting against US enemies in places such as Bosnia and Afghanistan (see 1989 and After). It is not known when Zahid got involved with the charity, but he is heading its Pakistani branch by 1988, when his nephew Ramzi Yousef first goes to Afghanistan (see Late 1980s). [REEVE, 1999, PP. 120] In the spring of 1993, US investigators raid Zahid’s house while searching for Yousef (see Spring 1993). Documents and pictures are found suggesting close links and even a friendship between Zahid and Osama bin Laden. Photos and other evidence also show close links between Zahid, KSM, and government officials close to Nawaf Sharif, who is prime minister of Pakistan twice in the 1990s. The investigators also discover that Zahid was seen talking to Pakistani President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari during a Mercy International ceremony in February 1993. [REEVE, 1999, PP. 48-49, 120] But despite the raid, Zahid apparently keeps his job until about February 1995, when Yousef is arrested in Pakistan (see February 7, 1995). Investigators learn Yousef had made a phone call to the Mercy office, and there is an entry in Yousef’s seized telephone directory for a Zahid Shaikh Mohammed. Pakistani investigators raid the Mercy office, but Zahid has already fled. [UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL, 4/11/1995; GUARDIAN, 9/26/2001; MCDERMOTT, 2005, PP. 154, 162] It is unclear what subsequently happens to Zahid. In 1999 it will be reported that he is believed to be in Kuwait, but in 2002 the Kuwaiti government will announce he is a member of al-Qaeda, so presumably he is no longer welcome there. [REEVE, 1999, PP. 48; LOS ANGELES TIMES, 9/1/2002] Mercy International’s Kenya branch will later be implicated in the 1998 US embassy bombing in that country, as will KSM, Zahid’s brother (see Late August 1998).

>Ali Mohamed, a spy for bin Laden working in the US military, trains Islamic radicals in the New York area. Mohamed is on active duty at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, at the time, but he regularly comes to Brooklyn on the weekends to train radicals at the Al-Kifah Refugee Center, a charity connected to both bin Laden and the CIA. Lawyer Roger Savis will later say, “He came quite often and became a real presence in that [Al-Kifah] office, which later metastasized into al-Qaeda.… He would bring with him a satchel full of military manuals and documents. It was Ali Mohamed who taught the men how to engage in guerrilla war. He would give courses in how to make bombs, how to use guns, how to make Molotov cocktails.” Mohamed’s gun training exercises take place at five different shooting ranges. One series of shooting range sessions in July 1989 is monitored by the FBI (Mohamed apparently is not at those particular sessions in person) (see July 1989). Mohamed’s trainees include most of the future bombers of the World Trade Center in 1993. [LANCE, 2006, PP. 47-49]

6. [July 1989: FBI Monitors Future Bombers’ Weapons Training Sessions; Fails to Follow Up](http://web.archive.org/web/20201117120007/http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a0789calverton#a0789calverton)
>FBI agents photograph Islamic radicals shooting weapons at the Calverton Shooting Range on Long Island, New York. The radicals are secretly monitored as they shoot AK-47 assault rifles, semiautomatic handguns, and revolvers for four successive weekends. The use of weapons such as AK-47’s is illegal in the US, but this shooting range is known to be unusually permissive. Ali Mohamed is apparently not at the range but has been training the five men there: El Sayyid Nosair, Mahmud Abouhalima, Mohammed Salameh, Nidal Ayyad, and Clement Rodney Hampton-El. Nosair will assassinate Rabbi Meir Kahane one year later (see November 5, 1990) and the others, except Hampton-El, will be convicted of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing (see February 26, 1993), while Hampton-El will be convicted for a role in the “Landmarks” bombing plot (see June 24, 1993). Some FBI agents have been assigned to watch some Middle Eastern men who are frequenting the Al-Kifah Refugee Center in Brooklyn. Each weekend, Mohamed’s trainees drive from Al-Kifah to the shooting range and a small FBI surveillance team follows them. The FBI has been given a tip that some Palestinians at Al-Kifah are planning violence targeting Atlantic City casinos. By August, the casino plot will have failed to materialize and the surveillance, including that at the shooting range, will have come to an end. Author Peter Lance will later comment that the reason why the FBI failed to follow up the shooting sessions is a “great unanswered question.” [LANCE, 2003, PP. 29-33; NEW YORK TIMES, 10/5/2003]

7. [November 5, 1990 and After: US Promotes Lone Gunman Theory in Kahane Assassination, Hiding Evidence of Al-Qaeda Links](http://web.archive.org/web/20180114094842/http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a110590lonegunmantheory#a110590lonegunmantheory)
>US government agencies cover up evidence of a conspiracy in the wake of El Sayyid Nosair’s assassination of controversial right-wing Zionist leader Rabbi Meir Kahane (see November 5, 1990). Nosair is captured a few blocks from the murder site after a police shoot-out. An FBI informant says he saw Nosair meeting with Muslim leader Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman a few days before the attack, and evidence indicating a wider plot with additional targets is quickly found. [VILLAGE VOICE, 3/30/1993] Later that night, police arrive at Nosair’s house and find a pair of Middle Eastern men named Mahmud Abouhalima and Mohammed Salameh there. They are taken in for questioning. Additionally, police collect a total of 47 boxes of evidence from Nosair’s house, including: [LANCE, 2003, PP. 34-35]
>
>- Thousands of rounds of ammunition.
>- Maps and drawings of New York City landmarks, including the World Trade Center.
>- Documents in Arabic containing bomb making formulas, details of an Islamic militant cell, and mentions of the term “al-Qaeda.”
>- Recorded sermons by Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman in which he encourages his followers to “destroy the edifices of capitalism” and destroy “the enemies of Allah” by “destroying their… high world buildings.”
>- Tape-recorded phone conversations of Nosair reporting to Abdul-Rahman about paramilitary training, and even discussing bomb-making manuals.
>- Videotaped talks that Ali Mohamed delivered at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
>- Top secret manuals also from Fort Bragg. There are even classified documents belonging to the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Commander in Chief of the Army’s Central Command. These manuals and documents had clearly come from Mohamed, who completed military service at Fort Bragg the year before and frequently stayed in Nosair’s house.
>- A detailed and top secret plan for Operation Bright Star, a special operations training exercise simulating an attack on Baluchistan, a part of Pakistan between Afghanistan and the Arabian Sea. [RALEIGH NEWS AND OBSERVER, 10/21/2001; RALEIGH NEWS AND OBSERVER, 11/13/2001; WALL STREET JOURNAL, 11/26/2001; ABC NEWS, 8/16/2002; LANCE, 2003, PP. 34-35]
>-Also within hours, two investigators will connect Nosair with surveillance photographs of Mohamed giving weapons training to Nosair, Abouhalima, Salameh, and others at a shooting range the year before (see July 1989). [LANCE, 2003, PP. 34-35] But, ignoring all of this evidence, still later that evening, Joseph Borelli, the New York police department’s chief detective, will publicly declare the assassination the work of a “lone deranged gunman.” He will further state, “I’m strongly convinced that he acted alone.… He didn’t seem to be part of a conspiracy or any terrorist organization.” The 9/11 Congressional Inquiry will later conclude, “The [New York Police Department] and the District Attorney’s office… reportedly wanted the appearance of speedy justice and a quick resolution to a volatile situation. By arresting Nosair, they felt they had accomplished both.” [VILLAGE VOICE, 3/30/1993; LANCE, 2003, PP. 34-36] Abouhalima and Salameh are released, only to be later convicted for participating in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. Investigators will later find in Nosair’s possessions a formula for a bomb almost identical to one used in the WTC bombing. [NEW YORK MAGAZINE, 3/17/1995] As one FBI agent will later put it, “The fact is that in 1990, myself and my detectives, we had in our office in handcuffs, the people who blew up the World Trade Center in ‘93. We were told to release them.” The 47 boxes of evidence collected at Nosair’s house that evening are stored away, inaccessible to prosecutors and investigators. The documents found will not be translated until after the World Trade Center bombing. Nosair will later be acquitted of Kahane’s murder (though he will be convicted of lesser charges), as investigators will continue to ignore all evidence that could suggest Nosair did not act alone (see December 7, 1991). [ABC NEWS, 8/16/2002; LANCE, 2003, PP. 34-37] District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, who prosecuted the case, will later speculate the CIA may have encouraged the FBI not to pursue any other leads. Nosair worked at the Al-Kifah Refugee Center which was closely tied to covert CIA operations in Afghanistan (see Late 1980s and After). [NEW YORK MAGAZINE, 3/17/1995]

>An attempt to topple the World Trade Center fails, but six people are killed and over 1000 are injured in the misfired blast. An FBI explosives expert later states that, “If they had found the exact architectural Achilles’ heel or if the bomb had been a little bit bigger, not much more, 500 pounds more, I think it would have brought her down.” Ramzi Yousef, who has close ties to bin Laden, organizes the attempt. [VILLAGE VOICE, 3/30/1993; US CONGRESS, 2/24/1998] The New York Times later reports on Emad Salem, an undercover agent who will be the key government witness in the trial against Yousef. Salem testifies that the FBI knew about the attack beforehand and told him they would thwart it by substituting a harmless powder for the explosives. However, an FBI supervisor called off this plan, and the bombing was not stopped. [NEW YORK TIMES, 10/28/1993] Other suspects were ineptly investigated before the bombing as early as 1990. Several of the bombers were trained by the CIA to fight in the Afghan war, and the CIA later concludes, in internal documents, that it was “partly culpable” for this bombing (see January 24, 1994). [INDEPENDENT, 11/1/1998] 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is an uncle of Yousef and also has a role in the WTC bombing (see March 20, 1993). [INDEPENDENT, 6/6/2002; LOS ANGELES TIMES, 9/1/2002] One of the attackers even leaves a message which will later be found by investigators, stating, “Next time, it will be very precise.” [ASSOCIATED PRESS, 9/30/2001]

>Lee, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, was the son of Lee Wing Chiu and Leung Lai Kuen. According to his father, he was a silent boy who did poorly in school, showed strange behaviour, and spoke incoherently. In 1976, he was admitted to Castle Peak Hospital, a mental institution, for six months, after fighting with a neighbour.[3] He subsequently received treatment at the Yaumati Psychiatric Centre.[2] Lee frequently had depression and threatened to kill his parents during an argument on New Year's Eve of 1979. In the time prior to the stabbing, he was unemployed and was said to have appeared emotionally unstable.[5]

>Purdy's mother remarried in September 1969; she divorced her husband four years later. Albert Gulart, Sr., Purdy's stepfather, said Purdy was an overly quiet child who cried often. In fall 1973, Kathleen separated from Gulart and moved with her children from Stockton to the Sacramento area. In December of that year, the Sacramento Child Protective Services were twice called to her residence, on allegations that Kathleen was physically abusing her children.[11] When Purdy was thirteen, he struck his mother in the face and was permanently banned from her house.[12] He lived on the streets of San Francisco for a period before being placed in foster care by authorities.[11] He was later placed in the custody of his father, who was living in Lodi, California, at the time.[12] While attending Lodi High School, Purdy became an alcoholic and a drug addict, and attended high school sporadically.[3][9]
>
>On September 13, 1981, Purdy's father was killed after being struck by a car.[12] His family filed a wrongful-death suit in San Joaquin Superior Court against the driver of the car, asking for US$600,000 in damages; the suit was later dismissed. Purdy accused his mother of taking money his father had left him, using the money to buy a car and taking a vacation to New York City. This incident appeared to deepen the animosity between them.[13][14] After his father's death, Purdy was briefly homeless, before being placed in the custody of a foster mother in Los Angeles.[11]
>
>Purdy's criminal activities had begun by 1977, when Sacramento police confiscated BB guns from then 12-year-old Purdy.[11] In June 1980, Purdy was first arrested at age 15 for a court-order violation.[12] He was arrested that same month for underage drinking. Purdy was then arrested for prostitution in August 1980,[15][16] possession of marijuana and drug dealing in 1982, and in 1983 for possession of an illegal weapon and receipt of stolen property. On October 11, 1984, he was arrested for being an accomplice in an armed robbery at a service station, for which he spent 32 days in the Yolo County Jail. In 1986, Kathleen called police after Purdy vandalized her car after she refused to give him money for narcotics.[9][17]
>
>In April 1987, Purdy and his half-brother Albert were arrested for firing a semi-automatic pistol at trees in the Eldorado National Forest. At the time, he was carrying a book about the white supremacist group Aryan Nations. He told the County Sheriff that it was his "duty to help the suppressed and overthrow the suppressor."[18] In prison, he twice attempted suicide, once by hanging himself with a rope made out of strips of his shirt, and a second time by cutting his wrists with his fingernails. A subsequent psychiatric assessment found him to have a mild mental impairment, and to be a danger to himself and others.[18][19]
>
>In the fall of 1987, Purdy began attending welding classes at San Joaquin Delta College; he complained about the high percentage of Southeast Asian students there. In October 1987, he left California and drifted among Oregon, Nevada, Texas, Florida, Connecticut, South Carolina, and Tennessee, searching for jobs. In early 1988, he worked at Numeri Tech, a small machine shop located in Stockton. From July to October 1988, he worked as a boilermaker in Portland, Oregon, living in Sandy with his aunt.
>
>On August 3 in Sandy, he purchased a Chinese-made AK-47 at Sandy Trading Post,[20] which he later used in the shooting. He eventually returned to Stockton and rented a room at the El Rancho Motel on December 26. After the shooting, police found his room decorated with numerous toy soldiers.[3][9][13] On December 28, Purdy purchased a Taurus pistol at Hunter Loan and Jewelry Company in Stockton.
>
>Police stated that Purdy had problems with alcohol and drug addiction. He talked openly of hatred toward Asian immigrants,[18] believing that they took jobs from "native-born" Americans.[14][21] According to Purdy's friends, who described him as friendly and never violent toward anyone, he was suicidal at times and frustrated that he failed to "make it on his own".[18] Steve Sloan, a night-shift supervisor at Numeri Tech, said: "He was a real ball of frustration, and was angry about everything." Another one of Purdy's former co-workers stated, "He was always miserable. I've never seen a guy that didn't want to smile as much as he didn't."[18] In a notebook found in a hotel where he lived in early 1988, Purdy wrote about himself in the following terms: "I'm so dumb, I'm dumber than a sixth-grader. My mother and father were dumb."[9]

He was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder as a teenager.[35] He later went on to study sociology at Northern Illinois University (NIU). Though his family moved to Florida in 2004, Kazmierczak continued his education in Illinois.[36][37] He enlisted in the United States Army in September 2001, and was discharged before completing basic training in February 2002 for lying on his application about his mental illness.[38][39] His mother died in Lakeland, Florida in September 2006 from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease or ALS).[40][41][42] At the time of Steven's death, his father was living in a retirement community in Lakeland.[43]

She said that he stopped taking Prozac about three weeks prior to the February 14 shooting. She also said that, during their two-year relationship, she had never seen him display violent tendencies and she expressed bewilderment over the cause of the rampage. "He was anything but a monster," she said. "He was probably the nicest, most caring person ever."[50]

Relatives said Neal, who moved to California in 2005, had a history of mental illness and anger management issues, as well as an obsession with conspiracy theories.[9][35] His mother had reportedly noticed a decline in his mental health since 2016.
>
>Neighbors complained to police about Neal firing guns from his property, but whenever sheriff's deputies visited his doorstep, Neal would not respond to their knocking.[29][8] A neighbor later said he believed Neal might have been testing the response time of law enforcement.[11] In total, deputies were called to Neal's Bobcat Lane home 21 times for various reasons in 2016 and 2017.[36]
>
>On January 31, 2017, Neal was arrested and charged with two felonies, and five misdemeanors, after stabbing neighbor Hailey Poland, assaulting her mother-in-law, and snatching a mobile phone away from them.[32] He was held on a US$160,000 bail bond, which was posted by his mother. His mother also spent $10,000 on legal fees to secure his release.[10][4] Following his release, Neal continued to harass the neighbors, causing them to successfully seek a restraining order that required him to surrender his firearms and not purchase additional guns.[1] He handed over a single pistol and attested that he had no other guns.[1][37] Police said that, despite this, he illegally manufactured the guns he used in the shootings.[29] Ghost guns are currently legal to manufacture in California, but the terms of Neal's restraining order made it illegal for him to possess them, or any other guns. Since January 31, 2018, ghost guns required a serial number in the state.[38] The two handguns that Neal possessed during his shooting rampage were not registered to him.[29]
>
>The day before the shootings, Neal called his mother to tell her he was "fed up" with his neighbors, whom he suspected of making methamphetamine.[10] He had previously attempted to report his neighbors to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.[29][39] One of the neighbors involved in the January 31 incident later became one of those killed in the shootings.[32] Although Danny Elliott had meth in his system when Neal killed him and had been put on probation in 2016 for a misdemeanor charge of possessing drug paraphernalia, sheriff's deputies and California Fire officials said they never found evidence of a meth operation, despite multiple visits to Bobcat Lane.[22]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Lee_Loughner#Background
>Jared Lee Loughner is the only child of Randy and Amy (née Totman) Loughner.[8][9][10] They were described by a neighbor as a very private family.[8] Amy Loughner worked for the City Parks Department. Randy Loughner was a retired gasoline truck driver, but journalists did not determine if he worked outside the house at the time of the shooting. While Loughner had friends in high school, neighbors noted that in the following years, he kept more to himself and rarely spoke to others.[11]

2. [Jared Lee Loughner - Behavior change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Lee_Loughner#Behavior_change)
>Loughner attended Mountain View High School, and dropped out in 2006.[9] Around this time, when he was about eighteen years old, those who knew him noted a change in his personality. Kelsey Hawkes, who dated Loughner for several months in high school, later said she was shocked after hearing of his arrest. "I've always known him as the sweet, caring Jared," said Hawkes, 21 at the time and then a student at the University of Arizona.[12]
>
>At some point, Loughner was fired from his job at a Quiznos restaurant, with his manager saying he had undergone a personality transformation. After this, Loughner briefly volunteered at a local animal shelter, walking dogs, but he was eventually asked not to return. The shelter manager later said, "He was walking dogs in an area we didn't want dogs walked...he didn't understand or comprehend what the supervisor was trying to tell him. He was just resistant to that information."[13]
>
>Loughner's former classmate and friend Tong Shan stated that her last encounter with Loughner was in October 2010, after he was suspended and dropped out of college and just before he purchased the semi-automatic handgun used in the shooting. She said that while Loughner was "anti-government," he never appeared violent, nor did he mention his plans to buy a gun.[14]
>
>According to court records, Loughner had two previous offenses:[15] in October 2007, he was cited in Pima County for possession of drug paraphernalia and on October 13, 2008, he was charged after defacing a street sign in Marana, near Tucson (a charge that was dismissed following the completion of a diversion program in March 2009).[13][16] The police report noted that he drew a stylized CX, which Loughner said were Christian symbols.[17]

3. [Jared Lee Loughner - Substance use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Lee_Loughner#Substance_use)
>Zach Osler, a high-school classmate of Loughner's and his closest friend, indicated that Loughner's life began to unravel after his high-school girlfriend broke up with him. He began to abuse alcohol and other drugs, including cannabis (marijuana), cocaine, psychedelic mushrooms, LSD, and Salvia divinorum (a hallucinogen legal in Arizona).[18][19]
>
>After struggling with drugs for more than two years, Loughner gave up alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs in late 2008 and has not used since, according to one of his longtime friends.[20] The U.S. Army confirmed that Loughner had been rejected as "unqualified" for service in 2008.[21][22][23] According to military sources, Loughner admitted to marijuana use on numerous occasions during the application process.[9]
>
>Former classmate Caitie Parker remembers Loughner as a "pot head".[24] Loughner has a history of drug use, having been arrested in September 2007 for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia.[25] "I haven't seen him in person since '07," Parker recalled in early 2011. "I'm looking back at this [as] a 14–19-year-old...who knows if any of us knew what for sure we were yet."[26]
>
>In the months leading up to the shooting, Loughner's parents became increasingly alarmed at their son's behavior; at one point, they resorted to disabling his car every night in order to keep him at home. On one occasion, his father confiscated his shotgun and both parents urged him to get help.[27] Loughner also became obsessed with controlling what he perceived to be lucid dreams.[28]

4. [Jared Lee Loughner - Suspension from college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Lee_Loughner#Suspension_from_college)
>From February to September 2010, while a student at Pima Community College, Loughner had five contacts with college police for classroom and library disruptions. Some of his teachers complained to the administration about his disruptions and bizarre behavior, as they thought it a sign of mental illness and feared what he might do. On September 29, 2010, college police also discovered a YouTube video shot by Loughner, in which his spoken commentary stated that the college was illegal according to the United States Constitution. He described his school as "one of the biggest scams in America".
>
>The college decided to suspend Loughner and sent a letter to his parents, to consult with them and him together.[30] The college told Loughner that if he wanted to return, he needed to resolve his code of conduct violations and obtain a mental health clearance (indicating, in the opinion of a mental health professional, that his presence did not constitute a danger to himself or others). On October 4, Loughner and his parents met with campus administrators and Loughner indicated he would withdraw from the college.[29] During Loughner's time at Pima, a classmate said she worried that he might commit a school shooting. One of his teachers has claimed a similar suspicion after the Tucson shooting.[citation needed] He never submitted to a mental health evaluation and did not return to the college.
>
>Several college classmates recalled an incident in which Loughner, during a class discussion, had mocked and laughed at a young woman who was describing her abortion. One classmate described Loughner's reaction as "wildly inappropriate".[14] "(Loughner) started making comments about terrorism and laughing about killing the baby," former classmate Don Coorough recalled to ABC News.[14][31] Yet another classmate, Lydian Ali, recalled that "a girl had written a poem about an abortion. It was very emotional and she was teary eyed and he said something about strapping a bomb to the fetus and making a baby bomb out of it."[32][33][34][35][36]

>Loi Khac Nguyen is a Vietnamese refugee who was part of a big family. His father, Bim Khac Nguyen, was a South Vietnamese soldier who escaped the country with his family in the 1970s. The family that comprised of six siblings got to California in 1980 and moved to Sacramento later. The four gunmen who attacked the store were 21-year-old Loi, his brothers — 19-year-old Pham Nguyen and 17-year-old Long Nguyen — and a family friend, 17-year-old Cuong Tran. All of them struggled at school, and Loi had dropped out in his senior year. He had difficulty finding employment at the time.

Mohammad Ahman al-Nazari was a 48-year-old resident of Sanaa, Yemen, and a veteran of the Soviet–Afghan War, where he had fought in the Mujahideen against the Soviet Union during their invasion of Afghanistan. Nazari's five children attended the Tala'i Private School in the Asbahi neighborhood of Sana'a, where it was alleged that one of his daughters had been molested by the school administrator, despite there being no evidence found to confirm this.[1] Nazari had also previously been employed as a bus driver for Tala'i Private School and the nearby Musa Bin Nusayr School, but was fired for unknown reasons some time before the shooting.

>Micah Xavier Johnson was born in Magee, Mississippi[62] and raised in Mesquite, Texas.[9][57][63][64] He once described his childhood as "stressful" during a VA visit on August 15, 2014, but further details were redacted on the visit report.[65] When he was four, his parents divorced.[64][66]
>
>Johnson transferred into John Horn High School when he was 17 and participated in its Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps program, according to the Mesquite Independent School District.[64][66] He struggled academically, graduating in 2009 with a 1.98 grade-point average and a ranking of 430 out of 453 students in his class.[64][67][68]

2. [2016 shooting of Dallas police officers - Military service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers#Military_service)
>Immediately after high school,[69] Johnson enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve and served from March 2009 to April 2015 as a 12W carpentry and masonry specialist.[70] He completed basic training, which required qualification on handling of an M16 rifle or M4 carbine, basic rifles for U.S. military personnel.[71] According to Justin Garner, a high-school friend and classmate who later served alongside Johnson in the same unit, Johnson lacked proficiency in certain required technical skills, such as marksmanship.[63] 
>
>Johnson was activated at the rank of private first class in September 2013 in support of the War in Afghanistan, where he was deployed from November 2013 to July 2014[3][66][72] with the 420th Engineer Brigade.[73]
>
>People who knew Johnson during his time in the Army described him as openly religious and often socializing with white soldiers.[68] A squad leader, who trained Johnson in tactical maneuvers and protection in 2009 and 2010, described him as "klutzy", "goofy sometimes", and "a nice guy", but also quiet and unmotivated.[74][75]
>
>Documents released by the Army on July 29 detailed early signs of disturbing behavior being exhibited by him, but specific details were redacted.[76] They also said that while Johnson was sociable, he was generally described by soldiers as a loner who sometimes ate his lunch in a vehicle alone while the rest of his unit ate outside together.[77] 

3. [2016 shooting of Dallas police officers - Discharge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers#Discharge)
>On May 1, 2014,[79] during his deployment, he was accused of sexual harassment by a female soldier, who sought a protective order against him and said that he needed mental health counseling.[64][80][81][82] The accusation was made after the soldier reported four pairs of women's underwear missing from her laundry bag. A "health and welfare inspection" of soldiers' rooms found one pair in Johnson's quarters, while a soldier discovered the remaining three in Johnson's pocket. Upon being confronted about it, Johnson fled with the undergarments and attempted to dispose of them in a nearby dumpster. He then lied that a female civilian acquaintance gave the underwear to him, but the female soldier confirmed that they were in fact hers.[77][78][83][84]
>
>The female soldier told investigators that she and Johnson had been platonic friends for five years, but had stopped talking to each other. She described their relationship as being tumultuous and involving fights and disagreements. She specifically recalled one incident where Johnson punched out a car window over her leaving for college and severed an artery, then forced her to bring him to a hospital for treatment. However, Johnson claimed that he punched out the window when the soldier missed a movie they planned to see together, and added that he had been under stress from his job and turbulent home life at the time.[79][85][86][87]
>
>According to the soldier, Johnson asked her for a pair of her underwear before the May 1 incident, but she declined. Also, during a Facebook conversation with her, Johnson mentioned "tying her down and having her face down on the bed" but then claimed the statement was a joke. Though she told him that rape was "never a joke" and to stop contacting her, the soldier did not report him for harassment at the time because she was used to that kind of rhetoric.[79][88] Though the May 1 incident did not meet the Army's criteria for sexual harassment, investigators found that Johnson's sexually suggestive comments to the female soldier met said criteria.[77][78][83][84]
>
>Following the inspection, he was disarmed under the recommendation of his platoon sergeant, who felt he posed a potential threat. Another Army official later described the action as unusual, as Johnson did not appear to be visibly agitated or a threat to himself or others at the time.[85][86] Johnson was then placed under 24-hour escort, which was reportedly a shameful and ostracizing experience,[64] before being temporarily moved to Bagram Airfield on May 3, but he did not have enough time to pack all of his belongings. While soldiers were emptying Johnson's quarters and packing his belongings for him on May 14, they discovered an unauthorized single M430I High Explosive Dual Purpose 40mm grenade, a .50-caliber round, and another soldier's prescription medication in his sleeping bag.[77][78][79][84]
>
>Later, the Army sent Johnson back to the U.S., and according to the military lawyer who represented Johnson at the time, the Army initiated proceedings to give Johnson an "other than honorable" discharge. The lawyer claimed this was "highly unusual" because written reprimands are usually issued before more drastic steps are taken, and also because the decision was allegedly based on a single sexual harassment allegation. The lawyer was evidently unaware of the grenade and other contraband discovered in Johnson's possession shortly before he was repatriated to the United States from Afghanistan as well as other factors in Johnson's possibly redacted record.[70][80][82] On the advice of his attorney, Johnson waived his right to a hearing in exchange for a more favorable general discharge under honorable conditions.[80][89] He was honorably discharged in September 2014, apparently as a result of an Army error.[81] Johnson remained in the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR), meaning he could be recalled into the Army if needed, and was part of the IRR at the time of his death.[67][85]
>
>Johnson received the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with campaign star, Army Achievement Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Armed Forces Reserve Medal, and NATO Medal for his tour of duty in Afghanistan.[30][74]
>
>Some of Johnson's fellow soldiers criticized the Army's handling of the case.[64][89]

4. [2016 shooting of Dallas police officers - Before the shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers#Before_the_shooting)
>The Veterans Health Administration released documents in August 2016 showing that Johnson had symptoms for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following his return from Afghanistan. He was not formally diagnosed with the condition, and doctors concluded that he presented no serious risk to himself or others. Johnson had sought treatment for anxiety, depression, and hallucinations, once telling doctors that he had experienced nightmares after witnessing fellow soldiers dying in explosions. Johnson also said that he would hear voices and mortars exploding; and that after returning to the U.S., he would be paranoid, suffer from lower back pain, and experience panic attacks a few times per week. For the latter condition, he recalled one incident at a Wal-Mart that required a police response. For his conditions, Johnson was prescribed several medications, including a muscle relaxant, an antidepressant, and anti-anxiety and sleep medication.[65]

>The gunman, identified as Charles Roberts IV, aged 32, was a milk tanker truck driver who served several Amish farms in the Nickel Mines area (including some of the victims' families). He had three children and a wife, for whom he left four separate suicide notes. When State Police Commissioner Jeffrey B. Miller interviewed Roberts' co-workers, they claimed to have noticed a "change" in him during the months immediately prior to the shooting. They also claimed that he seemed to return to normal in the week just before the shooting. Miller hypothesizes that this "calm" may have been when he (Roberts) decided to do the shooting. Miller also noted that Roberts' neighbors reported his mood as unusually jovial during this time period.[citation needed]
>
>Roberts was at the time a resident of nearby Georgetown, another unincorporated area of Bart Township.[12] His wife last saw him at 8:45 a.m. when they walked their children to a bus stop before she left. When Mrs. Roberts returned home a little before 11:00 a.m., she discovered four suicide notes; one addressed to herself and one to each of their three children. Roberts telephoned his wife from the schoolhouse using his cellphone and told her that he had molested two young female relatives (between the ages of 3 and 5) 20 years previously (when he was 12) and had been daydreaming about molesting again. One note Roberts left behind indicated his despondency concerning a daughter who died approximately 20 minutes after birth nine years earlier. He stated that he had "been having dreams for the past couple of years about doing what he did 20 years ago and he has dreams of doing them again", according to State Police Commissioner Colonel Jeffrey Miller. On October 4, 2006, the two relatives whom Roberts said he molested 20 years ago told police that no such abuse had ever happened, resulting in even greater confusion concerning the gunman's motive and mental state.[13] K-Y Jelly, a lubricant most commonly used for sexual intercourse, was also found in the schoolhouse among Roberts' belongings, possibly suggesting multiple motives for the incident.[3]

>That night Gómez, a member of the counterinsurgency corps, was standing guard at the gate of the military casino. At 3 a.m. he asked another soldier to be relieved, because he had to go to the toilet, but instead of the bathroom he went to his barracks and opened fire at the sleeping soldiers with a submachine gun. Afterwards the 19-year-old escaped to the village Río Caribe, where he tried to rent a boat to escape to Trinidad, but the owner of the vessel distrusted him and drove off, whereupon Gómez Romero opened fire. The shots missed its target, but alerted a policeman, already informed about the murders, who then arrested him.[5]

>Vang's father had served in a Laotian Civil War that was funded and organized by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). During the war, the CIA recruited the Hmong who lived in Laos and they assisted the CIA by disrupting supply routes which stretched from Laos to Vietnam during the Vietnam War. General Vang Pao was the leader of this army and as a result, he was regarded as a father figure by the Hmong.
>
>After the United States made the decision to withdraw troops from Laos in 1972, Vang and his family escaped the Hmong genocide that was ordered by the Pathet Lao in order to "exterminate the Hmong down to the last root" in retaliation for their assistance to the United States. Many Hmong were able to relocate to the U.S., however, thousands of them were left behind and killed. Vang and his siblings eventually relocated to the United States in 1980 and settled in California. Vang lived in Sacramento and eventually enlisted in the California National Guard.[2]
>
>Sometime around 2000, Vang and his family moved to St. Paul, Minnesota. Vang is the father of seven children. He is also a family shaman (txiv neeb) and was a hunting enthusiast.[2]
>
>On Christmas Eve 2001, police responded to a 911 call from Vang's house, according to a Minneapolis Police Department report. The quarrel began when Vang said he wanted to go out and his wife Xiong did not want him to leave, Vang's daughter Kia remembered. Kia Vang recalled running out of her room and seeing her father with a gun. Police arrested Chai Vang, but charges never were filed because, police said, Xiong did not cooperate with investigators. A few months later, Xiong moved with the couple's five children to live with her parents in Milwaukee. His second marriage ended after he nearly choked his wife to death for gambling away $3,000.[3][4]

>The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is a federally owned electric utility corporation in the United States. TVA's service area covers all of Tennessee, portions of Alabama, Mississippi, and Kentucky, and small areas of Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. While owned by the federal government, TVA receives no taxpayer funding and operates similarly to a private for-profit company. It is headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee, and is the sixth largest power supplier and largest public utility in the country.[3][4]
>
>The TVA was created by Congress in 1933 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. Its initial purpose was to provide navigation, flood control, electricity generation, fertilizer manufacturing, regional planning, and economic development to the Tennessee Valley, a region that had suffered from lack of infrastructure and poverty during the Great Depression, relative to the rest of the nation. TVA was envisioned both as a power supplier and a regional economic development agency that would work to help modernize the region's economy and society. Later it evolved primarily into an electric utility.[5] It was the first large regional planning agency of the U.S. federal government and remains the largest.

>Davison was diagnosed with autism and ADHD as a child and attended Mount Tamar school for special needs children.[24] He was a regular visitor to Shetland, where he spent long periods of time with his mother's relatives; it was there that initial concerns were raised about his mental state.[25] In 2016, Davison was reported to the police for allegedly attacking a man and his pregnant girlfriend not far from where the shooting would occur; Davison was warned by police but not prosecuted.[26] A close source to the family said that Davison had recently deteriorated after suffering from mental health problems for most of his life, and that his mother was "begging for help from the authorities but nobody did a welfare check".[27] During the UK's COVID-19 lockdowns in the eighteen months before the shooting, Davison had accessed a local mental health support charity.[28]
>
>Davison had been licensed to own a firearm since 2018, and police believe he used a legally-held firearm in the shooting.[21][29] Police had removed his shotgun and licence in December 2020 following an assault allegation described as "a row with two youths",[30] but the weapons were returned in early July 2021,[31] a month before the killings, after he completed an anger management course.[30][32] Following Devon and Cornwall Police's self-referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the agency investigated the service's previous dealings with Davison, its decision to grant him a firearms licence and the decision to reinstate the licence, and the decision to return his gun after it was temporarily revoked.[33][10]

>Sergey Aleksandrovich Pomazun (Серге́й Алекса́ндрович Помазу́н) was born on June 3, 1981, in Kupino, a village in Shebekinsky District, Belgorod Oblast, Soviet Union. His father, Alexander Pomazun, was a long-time employee at a fertilizer factory until leaving in the 1990s due to a serious salary delay, and ran a private hunting farm in the Shebekinsky district. His mother, Lyudmila Pomazuna, worked as an accountant in the local department of education. Pomazun attended Belgorod secondary school No. 42, where he was recorded as having poor grades at academic subjects but strong grades at practical subjects. In 1996, he entered the vocational school No. 33 training to be an auto mechanic. In 1999, Pomazun was conscripted into the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and approved for service by the military medical board, who placed him into Category "A" – those deemed fully mentally and physically fit without restrictions to their service. Pomazun was designated to an electronic warfare battalion in Belgorod Oblast, where he was appointed an electrician at the battalion's headquarters. According to colleagues, Pomazun was considered strange and people rarely noticed him.
>
>In 2002, Pomazun and an accomplice were found guilty of stealing two VAZ-2107 cars from private garages and scrapping them for private gain. He was sentenced to two years probation and ordered to pay 2000 rubles in compensation. In 2003, Pomazun was found guilty of stealing a VAZ-21213 car from a Belgorod hospital parking lot and a VAZ-2106 car from a private garage, scrapping them for profit, and during his arrest striking the arresting police officer in the ear. Pomazun received a 5-year and 1-month sentence at a low-security penal colony, but required only serving during weekdays and was allowed weekend furloughs at home. In September 2007, he was denied parole. In 2008, Pomazun was found guilty of stealing two cars, a Mazda 6 and a Lada 111, during his weekend breaks. On June 17, 2008, a court sentenced him to an additional 5-years and 4-months in a high-security penal colony, but an appeal on July 23, 2008, led to the sentence reduced to 4-years 10-months. Pomazun was sent to a penal colony in Belgorod before being transferred to one in Valuyki, where he had a record of bad behavior and received 29 individual penalties. According to his father, Pomazun had intentionally violated prison rules to be placed into the isolation ward to get away from the other inmates.
>
>On December 20, 2012, Pomazun was released from prison, moving in with his parents and living in a largely asocial life playing video games. Alexander Pomazun stated: "He began to notice that when deciding tickets, he began to talk. He repeated the same word five or six times. On many occasions he read aloud the same ticket, and then he was psychologically and swore with obscene language. He switched on and off the switch in the kitchen about 40 times in a row, talked to himself with a whisper, began to wander aimlessly around the room. He took out all our family photo albums, as well as his army photos, and burned them. When asked why he did this, he replied that they interfere, they are from a past life." Eventually, Pomazun decided to upgrade the vehicle category of his drivers license with the intention of becoming a taxicab driver and passed the theory test, but in April 2013 he failed the practical test. According to Alexander Pomazun, he had begun to behave aggressively returning from the test, and upon arriving home shouted about Chechnya and the GRU then attacked his father with a knife which he had previously purchased. Alexander fended off Pomazun, receiving only minor wounds and the next day handed him in to the local police station. Pomazun was not charged and was given advice by a police officer before being released, after which he failed the taxi practical test two more times. Upon failing his third test, Pomazun threatened to kill the instructor and their children, and began shouting about Chechnya and the GRU. Lyudmila Pomazuna appealed to the Belgorod Oblast branch of the Ministry of Internal Affairs about her son's behavior, but her application was reject. She instead contacted a psychological clinic, but was told they had no right to compulsory treatment of patients (Pomazun rejected treatment) and advised her to contact the police again. On April 19, 2013, Lyudmila Pomazuna appealed to the Belgorod Oblast state police but received no response.
>
>Around this time, Pomazun had conflict with a security guard that had insulted him and thrown him out of a department store in Belgorod. Pomazun decided to take revenge by planning to kill the guard, and even prepared for a possible shootout with guards of the store's private security.

Pomazun claimed that his battalion participated in a series of special operations in Chechnya in order to intimidate the population, where they killed nearly a thousand innocent people "all the way from Mozdok to Khasavyurt". He claimed Chechen civilians were crushed under tanks and that women and children were being beheaded, something that he says has since plagued him in his nightmares. But according to court documents, Pomazun never saw combat in the military and has never been to the North Caucasus, to which Pomazun replied that his service and missions were classified and refused to provide any more details.[7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]
